## Prompt [LS9_001] - MFA Implementation Foundation

### Context
The [`test_specs_manufacturer_security_foundation_LS8.md`](test_specs_manufacturer_security_foundation_LS8.md) defines comprehensive MFA requirements (lines 107-137), but [`src/auth/manufacturer_auth.py`](src/auth/manufacturer_auth.py) has no MFA implementation. Tests expect TOTP authentication, backup codes, and device management with <2s performance requirements.

### Objective
Implement complete Multi-Factor Authentication system with TOTP support, backup codes, and device management for manufacturer authentication.

### Focus Areas
- TOTP secret generation and QR code creation
- Time-window tolerant token verification
- Secure backup code generation and single-use enforcement
- Device registration and trusted device management
- Performance optimization for <2s authentication flows

### Code Reference
```python
# Current state - MFA methods completely missing
class ManufacturerAuthManager:
    # No MFA methods exist

# Expected interface from tests (line 108 in test_specs)
async def test_mfa_setup_and_totp_verification(self, real_auth_manager):
    mfa_setup = await real_auth_manager.setup_mfa(manufacturer_id)
    is_valid = await real_auth_manager.verify_mfa_token(manufacturer_id, totp_code)
```

### Requirements
- Implement `setup_mfa(manufacturer_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]` method
- Implement `verify_mfa_token(manufacturer_id: str, token: str) -> bool` method
- Implement `generate_backup_codes(manufacturer_id: str) -> List[str]` method
- Implement `verify_backup_code(manufacturer_id: str, code: str) -> bool` method
- Add device management with `register_trusted_device()` and `verify_device()` methods
- Use `pyotp` library for TOTP implementation
- Generate QR codes for authenticator app setup
- Implement secure storage for MFA secrets and backup codes
- Add comprehensive error handling with detailed context
- Ensure NIST 800-63B compliance for MFA implementation

### Expected Improvements
- Complete MFA functionality from 0% to 100% implementation
- Authentication security increased by 90% with MFA enforcement
- Performance target: <2s for complete MFA authentication flow
- Backup code security with single-use enforcement and regeneration

## Prompt [LS9_002] - Security Validator Async API Implementation

### Context
Tests expect async methods with specific signatures like `detect_threat(threat_type, data)` but [`src/security/manufacturer_validator.py`](src/security/manufacturer_validator.py:29) implements `detect_threat(value)` as a class method. The interface mismatch prevents proper threat detection integration.

### Objective
Refactor security validator to provide async API interface with comprehensive threat detection capabilities and ML-enhanced validation.

### Focus Areas
- Convert class methods to async instance methods
- Implement threat-specific detection methods
- Add ML-enhanced validation with confidence scoring
- Optimize pattern compilation for performance
- Add comprehensive business data validation

### Code Reference
```python
# Current implementation (line 29 in manufacturer_validator.py)
@classmethod
def detect_threat(cls, value: str) -> str:
    # Wrong signature and sync method

# Expected by tests (line 402 in test_manufacturer_authentication.py)
is_threat = await real_security_validator.detect_threat("sql_injection", product_data)
```

### Requirements
- Implement `async def initialize()` method for pattern loading
- Implement `async def detect_threat(threat_type: str, data: Any) -> bool` method

- Implement comprehensive business data validation (license, tax_id, email, phone)
- Add pattern compilation optimization for <10ms detection performance
- Include detailed threat context in validation results
- Add security scoring and risk assessment capabilities

### Expected Improvements
- API interface compatibility from 0% to 100%
- Threat detection accuracy improved by 85% with ML enhancement
- Performance target: <10ms per threat detection operation
- Business data validation coverage increased from 0% to 95%

## Prompt [LS9_003] - Encryption Manager Business Data Methods

### Context
Tests expect `encrypt_manufacturer_data()` and `decrypt_manufacturer_data()` methods with metadata support, but [`src/security/manufacturer_encryption.py`](src/security/manufacturer_encryption.py) only has basic `encrypt(bytes)` and `decrypt(bytes)` methods without business context.

### Objective
Extend encryption manager with business data methods, metadata support, key rotation, and compliance features for manufacturer data protection.

### Focus Areas
- Business data serialization and encryption
- Encryption metadata and versioning
- Key rotation and algorithm flexibility
- Compliance validation (FIPS 140-2, GDPR)
- Performance optimization for medium-sized data

### Code Reference
```python
# Current implementation - method doesn't exist
class ManufacturerEncryptionManager:
    def encrypt(self, data: bytes) -> bytes:  # Wrong signature

# Expected by tests (line 328 in test_manufacturer_authentication.py)
encrypted_data = await real_encryption_manager.encrypt_manufacturer_data(sensitive_data)
decrypted_data = await real_encryption_manager.decrypt_manufacturer_data(encrypted_data)
```

### Requirements
- Implement `async def encrypt_manufacturer_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]` method
- Implement `async def decrypt_manufacturer_data(encrypted_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]` method
- Implement `async def rotate_encryption_key(manufacturer_id: str) -> bool` method

- Implement key derivation with manufacturer-specific salts
- Add data residency and sovereignty compliance features
- Include comprehensive error handling for encryption failures
- Ensure FIPS 140-2 compliance for encryption operations

### Expected Improvements
- Business data encryption capability from 0% to 100%
- Encryption metadata and versioning support added
- Key rotation capability implemented for enhanced security
- Performance target: <100ms for medium-sized data encryption
- Compliance validation coverage increased to 100%

## Prompt [LS9_004] - Usage Limits Comprehensive Tracking

### Context
Test specifications define comprehensive usage limits by tier (lines 216-241 in [`test_specs_manufacturer_security_foundation_LS8.md`](test_specs_manufacturer_security_foundation_LS8.md)), but no implementation exists in [`src/auth/manufacturer_rbac.py`](src/auth/manufacturer_rbac.py) for tracking or enforcing these limits.

### Objective
Implement comprehensive usage limits tracking and enforcement system with real-time quota management and tier-based restrictions.

### Focus Areas
- Real-time usage tracking and quota enforcement
