This is a placeholder for the Product Q&A app icon.

In a real implementation, this would be an SVG or PNG file with the app's icon.

The icon would typically be:
- A simple, recognizable symbol representing Q&A functionality
- Using the brand colors (#4A90E2 primary color)
- Available in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 512x512)
- Optimized for display in the app store and in the merchant's admin dashboard

Design considerations:
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent with the VARAi brand guidelines
- Clearly communicates the app's purpose (Q&A)
- Works well on both light and dark backgrounds
