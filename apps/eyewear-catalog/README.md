- Product import with customizable options
- Scheduled sync jobs with cron expressions
- Webhook handling for Shopify events
- Detailed sync history and statistics
- Cache management for API performance
- MongoDB integration for data persistence

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- MongoDB 4.4+
- Shopify Partner account
- Shopify API credentials

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/eyewear-catalog
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```
# Shopify API
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2023-07
SHOPIFY_APP_HOST=https://your-app-domain.com

# Eyewear Database API
EYEWEAR_DB_API_URL=https://api.eyewear-database.com
EYEWEAR_DB_API_KEY=your_api_key
EYEWEAR_DB_API_VERSION=v1
EYEWEAR_DB_TIMEOUT=30000

```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Server** (`server.js`): Express application entry point
- **Services**: Business logic and external API communication
  - `eyewear-service.js`: Interface to the eyewear database API
  - `shopify-service.js`: Interface to the Shopify API
  - `sync-service.js`: Manages data synchronization processes
- **Routes**: API endpoints for the application
  - `auth.js`: Authentication endpoints
  - `webhooks.js`: Shopify webhook handlers
  - `sync.js`: Synchronization control endpoints
- **Utils**: Shared utilities
  - `db.js`: Database access layer
  - `logger.js`: Logging utility

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/sync/cancel` - Cancel a running sync process
- `GET /api/sync/settings` - Get sync settings for the shop

- `POST /webhooks/products/create` - Handle products/create webhook
- `POST /webhooks/products/update` - Handle products/update webhook
- `POST /webhooks/products/delete` - Handle products/delete webhook

## Synchronization Process

The app supports both manual and scheduled synchronization processes:

### Manual Sync

1. Initiated through the `POST /api/sync/start` endpoint
2. Fetches brands from the eyewear database
3. For each brand, fetches products in paginated requests
4. For each product, checks if it exists in Shopify
   - If it doesn't exist, imports it
   - If it exists, updates it (unless configured to skip existing)
5. Tracks progress and statistics throughout the process
6. Provides real-time status updates

### Scheduled Sync

1. Configure through the `POST /api/sync/settings` endpoint with a cron expression
2. The system automatically runs the sync process at the scheduled time
3. Follows the same steps as manual sync
4. Records results in the sync history

## Error Handling

The application implements robust error handling:

- API errors are captured and logged
- Sync errors are recorded but don't stop the overall process
- Import errors are tracked at the product level
- Webhooks always respond with 200 OK to acknowledge receipt

## Development

```bash
npm test
```
