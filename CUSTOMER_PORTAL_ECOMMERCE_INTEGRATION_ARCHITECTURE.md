    participant C as Customer
    participant P as Portal Dashboard
    participant A as Authentication
    participant S as Store Integration
    participant E as E-commerce Platform
    
    C->>P: Access Portal
    P->>A: Authenticate User
    A->>P: Return User Context
    P->>S: Request Store Connection
    S->>E: Connect to Platform
    E->>S: Return Store Data
    S->>P: Display Integration Status
    P->>C: Show Dashboard with Store Data
```

### API Architecture

#### Store Integration API Endpoints

1. **Store Connection API**
   ```
   POST /api/stores/connect/{platform}
   GET /api/stores/platforms
   GET /api/stores/status/{storeId}
   ```

2. **Platform-specific APIs**
   ```
   POST /api/stores/visioncraft/connect
   POST /api/stores/shopify/connect
   POST /api/stores/magento/connect
