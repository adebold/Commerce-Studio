       """
       
   @app.get("/products/search", response_model=ProductSearchResultSchema)
   async def search_products(query: str, limit: int = 10):
       """
       Search products by name, type, brand, etc.
       """
   ```

2. **Implement Face Shape Analysis Endpoints**
   ```python
   # Required Endpoints:

       """
       
   @app.get("/recommendations/face-shape/{face_shape}", response_model=List[ProductRecommendationSchema])
   async def get_recommendations_by_face_shape(face_shape: str):
       """
       Get product recommendations for specific face shape
       """
       
   @app.get("/recommendations/personalized", response_model=List[ProductRecommendationSchema])
   async def get_personalized_recommendations(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
       """

## Conclusion

The EyewearML platform has a **solid foundation** with working authentication, proper API structure, and good error handling. However, **all critical business functionality is missing**, preventing the platform from being production-ready.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure foundation is solid
- ‚úÖ Authentication system is functional
- ‚ùå Core business features are not implemented
- ‚ùå Database connectivity needs attention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis caching needs setup

Our expanded testing confirms that while the platform has a technically sound foundation, all business logic endpoints return 404 Not Found responses, indicating they haven't been implemented yet. The comprehensive tests we've added now define the expected behavior of these endpoints, providing a clear roadmap for implementation.

**Recommendation:** Focus on implementing core business endpoints and establishing proper database connectivity before proceeding with advanced features or deployment.

**Estimated Time to Production Readiness:** 4-6 weeks with focused development effort.
