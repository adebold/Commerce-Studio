# Manufacturer Role Test Suite

Comprehensive test-driven development (TDD) implementation for the manufacturer role feature in the eyewear ML platform. This test suite addresses all critical requirements identified in `test_specs_manufacturer_role_LS6.md` and follows the TDD principles outlined in the project's testing guidelines.

## Overview

The manufacturer role introduces business-critical functionality including:
- **Manufacturer Authentication & Authorization**: Secure onboarding and role-based access control
- **Centralized Product Repository**: High-performance product management with real database operations
- **Agentic Onboarding & Conversion Tracking**: AI-driven personalization and business intelligence
- **ML Tools Integration**: Face shape analysis, style matching, and virtual try-on capabilities
- **Dashboard Access Control**: Tier-based feature gating and security compliance

## Test Suite Architecture

### üî¥ RED PHASE (Current Status)
All tests are designed to **FAIL INITIALLY** until real implementations are created. This follows TDD principles where tests define the expected behavior before implementation.
