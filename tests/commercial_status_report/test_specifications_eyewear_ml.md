# Test Specifications: Eyewear-ML Commercial Status Report

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive test specifications and acceptance criteria for generating a Commercial Status Report for the **Eyewear-ML Platform** project. The report will be generated at [`docs/commercial_status/Eyewear_ML_Commercial_Status_Report.md`](docs/commercial_status/Eyewear_ML_Commercial_Status_Report.md) and must accurately represent the current state of the eyewear-ml platform.

## Test-Driven Development Approach

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **RED**: Write failing tests that define expected report structure and content
2. **GREEN**: Generate report content that passes all validation tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve report quality while maintaining test compliance
