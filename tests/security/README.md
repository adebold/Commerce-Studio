# Security Foundation TDD Test Suite (RED Phase)

This directory contains the TDD RED-phase test specifications for the **Security Foundation** batch of the Store Generation Service Foundation enterprise rewrite.

## 🎯 Test-Driven Development Approach

This test suite follows the **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** TDD cycle:

- **🔴 RED Phase** (Current): Write failing tests that define requirements
- **🟢 GREEN Phase** (Next): Implement minimal code to make tests pass  
- **🔄 REFACTOR Phase** (Final): Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.9+** with pip
2. **Virtual environment** (recommended)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the security test directory
cd tests/security

# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all Security Foundation tests (RED phase)
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test category
python run_tests.py --category zero_trust
python run_tests.py --category multi_tenant  
python run_tests.py --category compliance

# Setup environment only
python run_tests.py --setup-only
```

### Expected RED Phase Behavior

**🔴 ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL** during the RED phase. This is the expected and desired behavior.

The test failures drive the implementation requirements for the GREEN phase:

```

### Test Method Naming

- `test_<functionality>_<specific_requirement>()`
- Descriptive docstrings with requirements and acceptance criteria
- Clear assertion messages for failure analysis

### Test Data and Fixtures

- `@pytest.fixture` for reusable test data
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

## 🎯 Performance and Coverage Targets

### Coverage Requirements
- **Zero Trust**: >95% code coverage
- **Multi-Tenant**: >95% code coverage  
- **Compliance**: >98% code coverage

### Performance Requirements
- **Security checks**: <500ms
- **Access control decisions**: <5ms
- **Quota checks**: <3ms
- **Audit reports**: <2s

### Security Requirements
- **100%** prevention of unauthorized access
- **100%** prevention of cross-tenant data leakage
- **100%** compliance with applicable frameworks
- **Zero tolerance** for security vulnerabilities

## 🔄 TDD Workflow

### RED Phase (Current)
1. ✅ Write failing tests defining requirements
2. ✅ Establish test infrastructure and fixtures
3. ✅ Validate test coverage targets
4. ✅ Document expected failures

### GREEN Phase (Next)
1. 🔄 Implement minimal code to pass tests
2. 🔄 Focus on functionality over optimization
3. 🔄 Maintain test-driven approach
4. 🔄 Verify security requirements

### REFACTOR Phase (Final)
1. ⏳ Optimize performance and maintainability
2. ⏳ Enhance error handling and logging
3. ⏳ Improve code documentation
4. ⏳ Validate final compliance

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Implementation Rules

1. **No implementation code** should exist before tests fail in RED phase
2. **Import statements** in tests should fail initially (driving implementation)
3. **All assertions** should be meaningful and specific
4. **Test isolation** must be maintained (no shared state)

### Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Test security boundaries** explicitly
2. **Validate error conditions** and edge cases
3. **Test concurrent access** patterns
4. **Verify audit trails** are generated correctly
5. **Test performance** under security constraints

### Mock and Fixture Guidelines

1. **Mock external dependencies** (databases, APIs, etc.)
2. **Use realistic test data** that mirrors production
3. **Test both positive and negative scenarios**
4. **Validate error handling** and exception cases

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### RED Phase Success Indicators

- ✅ All 115+ tests fail as expected
- ✅ Test infrastructure executes without errors
- ✅ Requirements are clearly defined in test assertions
- ✅ Performance and security targets are established
- ✅ Test coverage targets are defined

### Transition to GREEN Phase

The Security Foundation test suite is ready for GREEN phase implementation when:

1. **All tests fail** with meaningful error messages
2. **Test infrastructure** runs reliably
3. **Requirements coverage** is comprehensive
4. **Performance benchmarks** are established
5. **Security targets** are clearly defined

**Next Steps:** Begin GREEN phase implementation by creating the source modules that these tests import and implementing the minimal functionality to make tests pass incrementally.
