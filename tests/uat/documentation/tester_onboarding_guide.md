## Introduction to UAT

### What is UAT?

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of the software testing process where actual users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios and meets the business requirements.

### Why is UAT Important?

UAT is critical because it:
- Validates that the software meets business requirements from a user perspective
- Identifies usability issues that may not be apparent to developers
- Ensures the software works in real-world scenarios
- Provides confidence that the software is ready for production
- Gives users an opportunity to provide feedback before the final release

### About the VARAi Platform

VARAi is an AI-powered platform for eyewear e-commerce that provides:
- Virtual try-on capabilities for eyewear products
- Personalized product recommendations
- Analytics and insights for merchants
- Integration with major e-commerce platforms

The platform has both merchant-facing components (for store owners and administrators) and customer-facing components (for shoppers).

## Your Role as a UAT Tester

### Responsibilities

As a UAT tester, you will:
1. Execute assigned test scenarios and test cases
2. Provide detailed feedback on your experience
3. Report any issues or defects you encounter
4. Suggest improvements to the platform
5. Participate in UAT meetings and discussions

### Types of UAT Testers

We have two main types of UAT testers:

   - Try to reproduce the issue to confirm it

2. **Documentation**
   - Document the issue in the feedback form
   - Include detailed steps to reproduce
   - Describe the expected vs. actual result
   - Assign severity and priority based on impact
   - Attach screenshots or videos if applicable

3. **Submission**
   - Submit the issue through the feedback form

   - Once the issue is fixed, you may be asked to verify the fix
   - Follow the same steps to confirm the issue is resolved
   - Provide verification feedback

### Issue Severity Levels
