## Introduction

This User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan outlines the approach, scope, and procedures for conducting UAT for the VARAi platform. The purpose of UAT is to validate that the platform meets the business requirements and is ready for production deployment.

The VARAi platform provides virtual try-on and product recommendation capabilities for eyewear e-commerce, with both merchant-facing and customer-facing components. This UAT plan covers both aspects of the platform.

## UAT Objectives

The primary objectives of the UAT are to:

1. Validate that the VARAi platform meets the business requirements and user expectations
2. Verify that the platform functions correctly in real-world scenarios
3. Identify any usability issues, bugs, or performance problems before production deployment
4. Collect feedback from actual users to improve the platform
5. Ensure the platform is ready for production use
6. Validate the end-to-end business processes
7. Confirm that the documentation is accurate and complete

## UAT Scope
