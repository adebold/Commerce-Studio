## Feedback Collection

### Collection Methods

1. **Structured Feedback Forms**
   - Digital forms (see `feedback_form.md`)
   - Paper forms (for in-person testing sessions)

2. **Moderated Testing Sessions**
   - Facilitator notes
   - Session recordings
   - Post-session debriefs

3. **Automated Collection**
   - In-app feedback widgets
   - Session recordings (with user consent)
   - Analytics data

### Collection Process

1. Distribute feedback forms to all UAT participants
2. Collect forms after each test scenario completion
3. Conduct debriefing sessions after test completion
4. Gather all feedback within 24 hours of test execution

## Feedback Aggregation

### Aggregation Tool

The feedback aggregation tool is implemented as a web application that:

1. Allows manual entry of feedback from paper forms
2. Imports digital form submissions automatically
3. Provides a dashboard for viewing all feedback
4. Generates reports and visualizations

### Aggregation Process

1. **Data Entry**
   - All feedback is entered into the system within 48 hours of collection
   - Each feedback item is linked to specific test scenarios and cases
   - Supporting materials (screenshots, videos) are attached

2. **Initial Processing**
   - Duplicate feedback is identified and merged
   - Feedback is validated for completeness
   - Clarification is requested for incomplete feedback

3. **Data Normalization**
   - Standardize terminology across feedback
   - Convert qualitative feedback to quantitative metrics where possible
   - Ensure consistent formatting

## Feedback Categorization

### Category Taxonomy

Feedback is categorized using the following taxonomy:

1. **Feedback Type**
   - Bug/Issue
   - Usability Concern
   - Feature Request
   - Performance Issue
   - Content Issue
   - Visual/Design Issue
   - Accessibility Issue
   - Security Concern
   - Documentation Issue
   - Other

2. **Component**
   - Virtual Try-On
   - Product Recommendations
   - User Profile
   - Shopping Experience
   - Merchant Onboarding
   - Product Management
   - Analytics Dashboard
   - Configuration Management
   - Integration Management
   - User Management
   - Other

3. **User Impact**
   - Blocking - Prevents core functionality
   - Major - Significantly impacts user experience
   - Moderate - Noticeable impact but workarounds exist
   - Minor - Minimal impact on user experience

4. **User Type**
   - Merchant
   - Customer
   - Administrator
   - All Users

### Categorization Process

1. Initial categorization is performed by the UAT coordinator
2. Categories are reviewed by the development team

## Feedback Prioritization

### Priority Levels

Feedback is prioritized using the following levels:

1. **P0 - Critical**
   - Must be resolved before launch
   - Blocks core functionality
   - No workarounds available
   - Affects all users

2. **P1 - High**
   - Should be resolved before launch
   - Impacts important functionality
   - Limited workarounds available
   - Affects many users

3. **P2 - Medium**
   - Should be resolved if time permits before launch
   - Impacts non-critical functionality
   - Workarounds available
   - Affects some users

4. **P3 - Low**
   - Can be resolved after launch
   - Minimal functional impact
   - Easy workarounds available
   - Affects few users

5. **P4 - Enhancement**
   - Feature requests and enhancements
   - No functional impact
   - Considered for future releases
