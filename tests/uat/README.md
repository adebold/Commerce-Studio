This directory contains the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan and infrastructure for the VARAi platform. The UAT process is designed to validate that the platform meets user requirements and expectations before final deployment.

## Directory Structure

- **plans/** - UAT test plans for merchant features and customer-facing components
- **scripts/** - Scripts for setting up and managing UAT environments
- **feedback/** - Feedback collection mechanisms and templates

## UAT Objectives

1. Validate that the VARAi platform meets the requirements and expectations of:
   - Merchants using the platform to integrate virtual try-on and recommendations
   - End customers using the virtual try-on and recommendation features
   
2. Identify any usability issues, bugs, or performance problems before final deployment

3. Collect and incorporate user feedback to improve the platform

4. Ensure the platform is ready for production use

## UAT Approach

The UAT process follows these steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Set up isolated UAT environments
   - Create test user accounts
   - Prepare test data
   - Train UAT participants

2. **Execution**:
   - Participants execute test scenarios
   - Feedback is collected through structured forms
   - Issues are logged and tracked
   - Results are documented

3. **Analysis**:
   - Feedback is aggregated and categorized
   - Issues are prioritized
   - Recommendations are formulated

4. **Reporting**:
   - UAT summary reports are generated
   - Results are presented to stakeholders
   - Go/no-go decision is made

## UAT Participants

UAT involves two main groups of participants:

1. **Merchant Representatives**:
