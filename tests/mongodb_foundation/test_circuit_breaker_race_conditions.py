"""
Enhanced Test-Driven Development for Circuit Breaker Race Condition Prevention

This test suite specifically addresses the HIGH SEVERITY race condition issue
identified in reflection_LS4.md for circuit breaker state management.

Critical Issue: Race condition where state checks and updates are not atomic,
leading to inconsistent state transitions during concurrent requests.

Location: src/reliability/circuit_breaker.py:88-98

Following TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle with focus on race condition prevention:
1. RED: Write failing tests that expose race conditions
2. GREEN: Implement atomic state management
3. REFACTOR: Optimize for production readiness
