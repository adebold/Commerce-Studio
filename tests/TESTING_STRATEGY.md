## Testing Approach

Our testing approach follows a multi-layered strategy to ensure the reliability and functionality of all e-commerce platform integrations:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows across the entire system
- **Performance Tests**: Measure and benchmark system performance
- **Monitoring Tests**: Verify monitoring and alerting systems

This approach allows us to catch issues at different levels of the system, from low-level implementation details to high-level user experiences.

## Test Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` and includes the following stages:

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and prepare the test environment
2. **Lint**: Check code quality and style
3. **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests for all platforms
4. **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests for all platforms
5. **E2E Tests**: Run end-to-end tests for critical flows
6. **Report**: Generate test reports and check coverage

### Docker Containers

We use Docker containers to create isolated testing environments for each platform. The Docker configuration is in `tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml` and includes:

- **Mock API**: A mock server that simulates the VARAi API
- **Magento**: A Magento instance for testing the Magento integration
- **WordPress/WooCommerce**: A WordPress instance with WooCommerce for testing
- **Test Runner**: A container that runs the tests

To start the Docker environment:

```bash
cd tests/e2e
docker-compose up -d
```

### Test Reporting

Test results are collected and presented in a comprehensive HTML report. The report includes:

- Test results by platform and test type
- Code coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Visual diffs for UI components

The report generation script is in `tests/scripts/generate-test-report.js`.

### Test Coverage Tracking

We track code coverage for all platforms and enforce minimum coverage thresholds:

- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

The coverage check script is in `tests/scripts/check-coverage.js`.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation. Each platform has its own unit test suite:

- **Shopify**: `apps/shopify/tests/unit/`
- **Magento**: `apps/magento/Test/Unit/` and `apps/magento/Test/js/`
- **WooCommerce**: `apps/woocommerce/tests/` and `apps/woocommerce/tests/js/`
- **BigCommerce**: `apps/bigcommerce/tests/unit/`

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. These tests focus on the interactions between our integrations and the e-commerce platforms:

- **Shopify**: `apps/shopify/tests/integration/`
- **Magento**: `apps/magento/Test/Integration/`
- **WooCommerce**: `apps/woocommerce/tests/integration/`
- **BigCommerce**: `apps/bigcommerce/tests/integration/`

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete user flows across the entire system. These tests are platform-agnostic and focus on critical flows:

- **Product Synchronization**: `tests/e2e/product-sync.test.js`
- **Virtual Try-On**: `tests/e2e/virtual-try-on.test.js`
- **Recommendations**: `tests/e2e/recommendations.test.js`
- **Webhook Handling**: `tests/e2e/webhook-handling.test.js`
- **Integration Monitoring**: `tests/e2e/integration-monitoring.test.js`

## Critical Flows

### Product Synchronization

Tests verify that product data is correctly synchronized between e-commerce platforms and the VARAi system:

- Product creation in platform → VARAi
- Product updates in platform → VARAi
- Product updates in VARAi → platform
- Product deletion in platform → VARAi

### Virtual Try-On

Tests verify that the virtual try-on functionality works correctly:

- Try-on button appears on product pages
- Camera access works correctly
- Face shape detection works correctly
- 3D model rendering works correctly
- Style score is displayed correctly

### Recommendation Engine

Tests verify that product recommendations are correctly displayed and tracked:

- Recommendations appear on product pages
- Recommendations are personalized based on user data
- Recommendation impressions are tracked
- Recommendation clicks are tracked
- Recommendations can be filtered and sorted

### Webhook Handling

Tests verify that webhooks are properly processed:

- Product creation webhooks are processed correctly
- Product update webhooks are processed correctly
- Product deletion webhooks are processed correctly
- Webhooks with invalid signatures are rejected
- Webhook processing errors are handled gracefully

### Integration Monitoring

Tests verify that the monitoring infrastructure works correctly:

- Health check endpoints return correct status
- Monitoring dashboard displays integration status
- Alerts are triggered when health checks fail
- Performance benchmarks are tracked
- Logs are properly recorded and searchable

## Integration Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints

Each platform integration has a health check endpoint that returns the current status:

- **Shopify**: `/health/shopify`
- **Magento**: `/health/magento`
- **WooCommerce**: `/health/woocommerce`
- **BigCommerce**: `/health/bigcommerce`

The health check response includes:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-30T11:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "details": {
    "api": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "API connection successful"
    },
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "webhooks": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Webhooks configured correctly"
    }
  },
  "performance": {
    "responseTime": 120,
    "requestsPerMinute": 45,
    "errorRate": 0.01
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard displays the status of all integrations and provides detailed metrics:

- **Status Overview**: Current status of all integrations
- **Metrics**: Response time, request rate, error rate
- **Alerts**: Recent alerts and their status
- **Logs**: Searchable logs for debugging

### Alerting

Alerts are triggered when:

- Health check fails
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Response time exceeds threshold
- Webhook processing fails

Alerts can be sent via:

- Email
- Slack
- SMS
- PagerDuty

### Performance Benchmarks

We track performance benchmarks for each integration:

- **Response Time**: p95, p99, avg
- **Throughput**: Requests per minute
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

### Logging

Logs are collected and centralized for debugging:

- **Platform**: Which platform the log is from
- **Level**: Info, warning, error, debug
- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Message**: Description of the event
- **Request/Response**: HTTP request and response details

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Access to test accounts for each platform

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests for a specific platform:

```bash
cd apps/<platform>
npm test
```

### Running Integration Tests

To run integration tests for a specific platform:

```bash
cd apps/<platform>
npm run test:integration
```

### Running E2E Tests

To run all E2E tests:

```bash
cd tests/e2e
docker-compose up -d
npm run test:e2e
```

To run a specific E2E test:

```bash
cd tests/e2e
npm run test:e2e -- --testMatch="**/product-sync.test.js"
```

### Running All Tests

To run all tests and generate a report:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests fail with "Cannot connect to API" errors**
   - Check that the mock API server is running
   - Verify API key configuration

2. **E2E tests fail with "Element not found" errors**
   - Check that the platform UI hasn't changed
   - Update selectors in the test files

3. **Webhook tests fail**
   - Verify webhook configuration in the platform
   - Check webhook secret configuration

4. **Performance tests fail**
   - Check if the system is under heavy load
   - Verify that benchmarks are realistic

### Debugging

1. **Enable verbose logging**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Run tests with headful browser**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e -- --headed
   ```

3. **Slow down test execution**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e -- --slow-mo=100
   ```

4. **Check test screenshots**
   ```
   test-results/screenshots/
   ```
