## Introduction

Partner testing is a critical step in ensuring that e-commerce platform integrations work correctly with the VARAi platform. This document provides guidelines for partners to test their integrations and prepare for certification.

4. **Ensure Compatibility** - Verify compatibility with different configurations
5. **Prepare for Certification** - Prepare the integration for formal certification

### Testing Scope

Partner testing should cover:

- **Core Integration Features** - Authentication, product sync, order processing, etc.
- **Platform-Specific Features** - Features specific to your e-commerce platform
- **Error Handling** - How the integration handles various error conditions
- **Performance** - How the integration performs under different loads
- **User Experience** - The overall user experience of the integration
