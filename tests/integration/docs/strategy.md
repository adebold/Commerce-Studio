# VARAi Integration Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integration testing of the VARAi platform. Integration testing verifies that different components of the system work together correctly and that the system as a whole meets the requirements.

## Goals

The goals of integration testing are to:

1. Verify that components interact correctly with each other
2. Ensure that data flows correctly through the system
3. Validate that the system meets functional requirements
4. Identify issues that may not be caught by unit tests
5. Ensure that the system is reliable and performs well under load

## Test Scope

Integration testing covers the following areas:

### Functional Areas

- User authentication and authorization
- Product recommendation flows
- Virtual try-on functionality
- Analytics data collection
- E-commerce platform integrations
- Multi-tenant functionality

### Integration Points

- Frontend to backend API integration
- Service-to-service communication
- Database interactions
- Third-party service integrations
- E-commerce platform integrations

## Test Approach

### Test Types

1. **API Integration Tests**: Verify that API endpoints work correctly and that data flows correctly between services.
2. **UI Integration Tests**: Verify that the UI interacts correctly with backend services.
3. **Service Integration Tests**: Verify that services interact correctly with each other.
4. **Database Integration Tests**: Verify that services interact correctly with the database.
5. **Third-Party Integration Tests**: Verify that the system interacts correctly with third-party services.
6. **End-to-End Tests**: Verify complete user flows from start to finish.
7. **Performance Tests**: Verify that the system performs well under load.

### Test Environments

Integration tests run in isolated environments to ensure that tests don't interfere with each other. The test environments include:

1. **Containerized Services**: Each service runs in its own container.
2. **Test Databases**: Isolated databases for testing.
3. **Mock External Services**: Mock implementations of external services.
4. **Test Data**: Predefined test data for consistent test results.

### Test Execution

Integration tests run as part of the CI/CD pipeline and can also be run locally during development. The tests run in the following order:

1. Unit tests
2. API integration tests
3. Service integration tests
4. Database integration tests
5. UI integration tests
6. End-to-end tests
7. Performance tests

## Test Implementation

### Test Frameworks

- **API Tests**: Jest, Supertest
- **UI Tests**: Playwright
- **Service Tests**: Jest
- **Database Tests**: Jest, MongoDB Memory Server
- **Performance Tests**: k6

### Test Structure

Tests are organized by functional area and test type. Each test file focuses on a specific aspect of the system and includes setup, test cases, and teardown.

Example test structure:

```
tests/integration/
├── auth/
│   ├── api.test.js
│   ├── ui.test.js
│   └── service.test.js
├── recommendations/
│   ├── api.test.js
│   ├── ui.test.js
│   └── service.test.js
...
```

### Test Data

Test data is defined in fixture files and loaded as needed by tests. The test data includes:

- User accounts with different roles
- Product data
- Customer data
- Order data
- Configuration data

### Mocking

External services are mocked to ensure that tests are reliable and don't depend on external systems. Mocks are implemented using:

- Mock servers for HTTP services
- In-memory databases for database services
- Mock implementations for other services

## Test Reporting

Test results are reported in the following formats:

- JUnit XML for CI/CD integration
- HTML reports for human readability
- Console output for local development

## Continuous Integration

Integration tests run as part of the CI/CD pipeline on:

- Pull requests to main and develop branches
- Pushes to main and develop branches

The CI pipeline includes:

1. Building the application
2. Running unit tests
3. Running integration tests
4. Generating test reports
5. Deploying to staging (if all tests pass)

## Maintenance

Integration tests are maintained by:

- Updating tests when requirements change
- Adding new tests for new features
- Removing tests for deprecated features
- Refactoring tests to improve reliability and performance

## Responsibilities

- **Development Team**: Implement and maintain integration tests
- **QA Team**: Review test coverage and quality
- **DevOps Team**: Maintain test infrastructure
- **Product Team**: Define test requirements and acceptance criteria
