# Commerce Studio Service Merge Conflict Resolution

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to resolve the merge conflict in `frontend/src/services/commerce-studio.ts`. The conflict arose from differences in the Commerce Studio service implementation between branches:

1. The original implementation in `frontend/src/services/commerce-studio.ts` - A basic service with product-related functionality
2. Another implementation that included pricing plan functionality used by the HomePage component

The merged implementation preserves the core functionality from both branches while ensuring compatibility with the HomePage component.

## Key Changes

### 1. Added PricingPlan Interface

Added the PricingPlan interface that was missing from the original implementation but required by the HomePage component:

```typescript
export interface PricingPlan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: string;
  period: string;
  description: string;
  features: string[];
  buttonText: string;
  buttonVariant: 'contained' | 'outlined';
}
```

### 2. Added Mock Pricing Plan Data

Added mock pricing plan data to support the getPricingPlans method:

```typescript
const mockPricingPlans: PricingPlan[] = [
  {
    id: 'plan-1',
    name: 'Starter',
    price: '$99',
    period: '/month',
    description: 'Perfect for small businesses just getting started with AI-powered eyewear retail.',
    features: [
      'Virtual Try-On (100 sessions/mo)',
      'Basic Style Recommendations',
      'Standard Support',
      'Single Store Integration'
    ],
    buttonText: 'Get Started',
    buttonVariant: 'outlined'
  },
  // Additional plans...
];
```

### 3. Added getPricingPlans Method

Added the getPricingPlans method that was missing from the original implementation but called by the HomePage component:

```typescript
// Get pricing plans
getPricingPlans: async (): Promise<PricingPlan[]> => {
  // In a real app, this would make an API call
  // For now, we'll simulate a delay and return mock data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 700));
  return mockPricingPlans;
}
```

### 4. Preserved Existing Functionality

Maintained all existing functionality from the original implementation:
- Product interface
- Mock product data
- getProducts method
- getProductById method
- searchProducts method

## Usage Examples

### Get Products

```typescript
const products = await commerceStudioService.getProducts();
```

### Get Pricing Plans

```typescript
const pricingPlans = await commerceStudioService.getPricingPlans();
```

### Get Product by ID

```typescript
const product = await commerceStudioService.getProductById('product-1');
```

### Search Products

```typescript
const searchResults = await commerceStudioService.searchProducts('virtual');
```

## Next Steps

1. The HomePage.tsx file has TypeScript errors related to Material-UI's Grid component usage and RBAC import. These should be addressed separately as they are not directly related to the commerce-studio.ts merge conflict.
2. Consider implementing real API calls instead of mock data in a future update.
3. Add proper error handling for API calls.
4. Add unit tests for the Commerce Studio service.
