# Refined Code Prompts for LS4 - Framework Execution Strategy

## Context Summary

**CRITICAL FRAMEWORK PARADOX IDENTIFIED**: The VARAi Commerce Studio website has comprehensive test frameworks (80.8% readiness) but executes only 14.6% of them, creating a dangerous 66.2% execution gap. The overall score has deteriorated from 42.8 to 38.2 (-4.6 decline) while maintaining a misleading 100% pass rate on basic connectivity tests.

**Root Cause**: [`simple-test-runner.js`](website/test-framework/simple-test-runner.js:29) executes only 11 basic HTTP tests instead of the comprehensive [`tdd-orchestrator.js`](website/test-framework/tdd-orchestrator.js:27) with 100+ tests across 8 categories.

**Critical Discovery**: The solution is not to build new frameworks but to **execute existing ones**.

## Prompt [LS4_001] - Emergency Security Framework Activation

### Context
Zero security validation exists despite a comprehensive 85% complete [`SecurityTestSuite`](website/test-framework/test-runners/security-tests.js:21) framework. The commerce platform handles sensitive business data with no security testing, creating unacceptable legal and compliance risks.

### Objective
Immediately activate the existing security test framework to achieve minimum 75/100 security score and eliminate critical production deployment risks.

### Focus Areas
- Execute existing XSS payload testing with comprehensive injection scenarios
- Activate HTTPS enforcement and SSL certificate validation
- Run security headers verification (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Implement authentication security validation
- Execute data protection compliance checks

### Code Reference
```javascript
// EXISTING FRAMEWORK READY FOR IMMEDIATE EXECUTION
class SecurityTestSuite {
    constructor() {
        // XSS payloads already defined and ready
        this.xssPayloads = [
            '<script>alert("XSS")</script>',
            '"><script>alert("XSS")</script>',
            // ... comprehensive payload library exists
        ];
        
        // Test metrics structure already implemented
        this.testResults = {
            security: { 
                metrics: {
                    httpsEnforcement: { score: 0, tested: false },
                    securityHeaders: { score: 0, tested: false },
                    inputValidation: { score: 0, tested: false }
                }
            }
        };
    }
    // FRAMEWORK EXISTS - NEEDS EXECUTION ACTIVATION
}
```

### Requirements
- Activate existing security test methods in [`security-tests.js`](website/test-framework/test-runners/security-tests.js:21)
- Execute comprehensive XSS testing using predefined payloads
- Run HTTPS/SSL validation using existing Node.js crypto integration
- Activate security headers verification with existing header requirements
- Execute authentication flow security validation
- Run data protection compliance checks
- Integrate results into existing test metrics structure

### Expected Improvements
- Security score: 15.2 → 75+ (target: 59.8 point improvement)
- Framework utilization: 0% → 85% security framework execution
- Eliminate "Security Framework Paradox" critical issue
- Remove deployment blocking security gate failure

## Prompt [LS4_002] - TDD Orchestrator Integration and Quality Gate Enforcement

### Context
The [`TDDOrchestrator`](website/test-framework/tdd-orchestrator.js:27) exists with comprehensive quality gates and deployment blocking mechanisms but is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Current [`run-tests.js`](website/test-framework/run-tests.js:14) uses simple test execution instead of comprehensive orchestration.

### Objective
Replace simple test execution with TDD orchestrator integration to implement quality gates, deployment blocking, and comprehensive test coverage enforcement.

### Focus Areas
- Replace simple test runner with TDD orchestrator execution
- Activate quality gate enforcement with configurable thresholds
- Implement deployment blocking for failed quality gates
- Execute comprehensive test suite instead of basic HTTP tests
- Integrate production readiness assessment

### Code Reference
```javascript
// EXISTING TDD ORCHESTRATOR READY FOR INTEGRATION
class TDDOrchestrator {
    constructor() {
        // Quality gates already defined and configured
        this.qualityGates = {
            security: {
                minimumScore: 75,
                weight: 30,
                blocking: true,
                description: 'Security validation (XSS, HTTPS, Headers)'
            },
            forms: {
                minimumScore: 85,
                weight: 25,
                blocking: true,
                description: 'Form validation and user journey testing'
            }
            // ... comprehensive quality gates exist
        };
        
        // Production readiness criteria already implemented
        this.productionReadiness = {
            minimumOverallScore: 80,
            minimumCoverage: 80,
            maxCriticalIssues: 0,
            maxHighIssues: 2
        };
    }
    // ORCHESTRATOR EXISTS - NEEDS CI/CD INTEGRATION
}
```

### Requirements
- Modify [`run-tests.js`](website/test-framework/run-tests.js:14) to use TDD orchestrator instead of simple test suite
- Activate quality gate validation with existing threshold configuration
- Implement deployment blocking logic for failed quality gates
- Execute comprehensive test categories (security, forms, accessibility, performance)
- Integrate production readiness assessment with existing criteria
- Add comprehensive reporting with quality gate status
- Create CI/CD pipeline integration with deployment blocking

### Expected Improvements
- Test execution: Simple (11 tests) → Comprehensive (100+ tests)
- Quality gate enforcement: 0% → 100% (all gates active)
- Framework utilization: 14.6% → 80+ (comprehensive execution)
- Deployment safety: False confidence → Quality gate protected

    constructor() {
        // Test data already comprehensive and ready
        this.testData = {
            validEmails: ['test@example.com', 'user.name@domain.co.uk'],
            invalidEmails: ['invalid', 'test@', '@domain.com'],
            weakPasswords: ['123', 'password', 'abcdefgh'],

            // ... comprehensive test data exists
        };
        
        // Test metrics structure already implemented
        this.testResults = {
            forms: { 
                metrics: {
                    emailValidation: { score: 0, tested: false },
                    passwordValidation: { score: 0, tested: false },
                    multiStepLogic: { score: 0, tested: false }
                }
            }

### Code Reference
```javascript
// EXISTING ACCESSIBILITY FRAMEWORK READY FOR EXECUTION
class AccessibilityTestSuite {
    constructor() {
        // Test pages already prioritized and configured
        this.testPages = [
            { path: '/', name: 'Home', priority: 'high' },
            { path: '/signup/index.html', name: 'Signup', priority: 'critical' },
            { path: '/dashboard/index.html', name: 'Dashboard', priority: 'high' }
            // ... comprehensive page coverage exists

## Prompt [LS4_005] - Comprehensive Test Suite Integration

### Context
The [`ComprehensiveTestSuite`](website/test-framework/comprehensive-test-suite.js:11) contains 100+ tests across 8 categories but is not integrated into the test execution pipeline. Current execution uses only 11 basic HTTP connectivity tests, creating an 85% coverage gap.

            crossBrowser: { passed: [], failed: [] },    // 16+ tests ready
            security: { passed: [], failed: [] }         // 10+ tests ready
        };
        
        // Test data already comprehensive and configured
        this.testData = {
            pages: [/* comprehensive page definitions */],
            viewports: [/* responsive testing viewports */],
