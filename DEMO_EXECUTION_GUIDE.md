## 2. Demo Script & Flow (15-20 Minutes)

*Goal: Guide the customer through a compelling narrative that highlights the system's value.*

### A. Opening (2 mins)
*   **Introduction:** "Welcome! Today, we're excited to show you our live, intelligent consultation system. We've moved beyond static web pages to create a personalized, guided journey for every user, powered by an advanced machine learning engine."
*   **Value Proposition:** "Our goal is to replicate the expertise of an in-store optician, online, 24/7. This system doesn't just answer questions; it understands customer needs, provides expert recommendations, and drives sales by building confidence and trust."

### B. Step-by-Step Demonstration (10 mins)
*   **(You, the presenter, will drive this part of the demo)**
*   **Step 1: Initiate Consultation:**
    *   **Action:** Open the [Demo Store](https://storage.googleapis.com/eyewear-demo-store-ml-datadriven-recos/index.html). Click on the chat widget.
    *   **Talking Point:** "Let's start from the perspective of a new customer. They land on your site and are immediately greeted by our AI consultant, ready to help them find the perfect pair of glasses."
*   **Step 2: Natural Language Interaction:**
    *   **Action:** Type a simple, open-ended query like: "I need new glasses."
    *   **Talking Point:** "The system uses natural language understanding. Customers can talk to it just like they would a person. The AI will then guide them through a series of questions to narrow down their preferences."
*   **Step 3: Guided questioning (Personalization):**
    *   **Action:** Follow the AI's prompts. Answer questions about face shape, style preferences (e.g., "modern," "vintage"), and primary use (e.g., "for computer work," "for driving").
    *   **Talking Point:** "This is where our ML engine shines. The AI isn't just matching keywords; it's building a profile of the customer's needs. It asks about face shape for fit, lifestyle for lens type, and personal style for frame selection. Each question is designed to deliver a highly accurate recommendation."
*   **Step 4: Product Recommendation:**
    *   **Action:** The AI will present a few recommended products directly in the chat.
    *   **Talking Point:** "Based on our conversation, the system has identified the top 3 frames that match the customer's criteria. They can see the product, price, and click to view details, all without leaving the chat."

### C. Customer Interaction (3 mins)
*   **(Now, let the customer try)**
*   **Transition:** "Now, I'd like you to try it for yourself. Think of a specific need you might have for glasses."
*   **Action:** Let the customer take over and interact with the chatbot.
*   **Guiding Questions:**
    *   "What kind of style are you looking for today?"
    *   "Try asking it something specific, like 'Do you have any lightweight titanium frames?'"
*   **Handle Questions:** Answer their questions about the technology as they use it.
