## **🚨 DEPLOYMENT STATUS ISSUE**

### **Problem**
The git repository is currently processing a massive cleanup operation (2,516 duplicate files) which has created git lock files preventing new commits. This means:

1. **Current GCP deployment** does NOT include Stripe payment functionality
2. **Payment infrastructure exists** but is not yet deployed
3. **Git operations are blocked** until cleanup completes

### **Solution in Progress**
1. **Git cleanup operations** are running in 3 terminals (processing 2,516 file deletions)
2. **GCP deployment** is running in parallel (Terminal 4)
3. **Once git operations complete**, we can commit and redeploy with payment functionality

## **📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Wait for Git Operations to Complete**
- Monitor terminals 1, 2, and 3 for completion
- Git lock files will be automatically removed
- Repository will return to normal state

### **2. Commit Stripe Payment Infrastructure**
```bash
git add website/js/billing-manager.js
git add website/api/stripe/config.js  
git add terraform/modules/stripe/
git add scripts/stripe-product-setup.js
git add STRIPE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "💳 Add comprehensive Stripe payment infrastructure

- Complete billing manager with subscription management
- Credit card processing and payment method management
- Token system with usage tracking and purchases
- Terraform infrastructure for automated deployment
- Webhook processing and monitoring
- Setup scripts and documentation

Includes all payment functionality for customer credit card processing."
```

### **3. Redeploy to GCP with Payment Functionality**
```bash
./deploy-website-to-gcp.sh
```
