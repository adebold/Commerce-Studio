- **Conversion Funnel Analysis**: Visualization of how each variant performs at different stages of the purchase funnel.
- **Confidence Metrics**: Statistical confidence levels for test results to guide decision-making.
- **Historical Trends**: Time-series data showing how test performance evolves over time.

### 2. Recommendation Engine Analytics

- **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics for recommendation engine performance including click-through rate and conversion rate.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Comparative analysis of different recommendation algorithms (face shape, style preference, browsing history, etc.).
- **Top Recommended Products**: Insights into which products are most frequently recommended to users.
- **Highest Converting Recommendations**: Analysis of which recommended products lead to the highest conversion rates.
- **Trend Analysis**: Time-series data showing how recommendation performance changes over time.

### 3. Face Shape Analytics

- **Face Shape Distribution**: Breakdown of user face shapes to understand customer demographics.
- **Conversion by Face Shape**: Analysis of how different face shapes convert to identify opportunities.
- **Compatibility Impact**: Visualization of how face shape compatibility scores correlate with conversion rates.
- **Product Performance by Face Shape**: Insights into which products perform best for each face shape.

### 4. Key Business Metrics

- **Conversion Rate**: Overall store conversion rate with trend indicators.
- **Average Order Value**: Tracking of AOV with comparison to previous periods.
- **Recommendation CTR**: Click-through rate for recommended products.
- **Active Tests**: Overview of currently running A/B tests.

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into tabs for different analytics categories:
- A/B Testing
- Recommendations
- Face Shape Analytics

Each tab contains relevant charts and metrics specific to that category, providing a focused view while maintaining a cohesive overall experience.

### Data Visualization

The dashboard uses Chart.js for data visualization, providing:
- Line charts for time-series data
- Bar charts for comparative analysis
- Pie charts for distribution analysis
- Radar charts for multi-dimensional data

### Integration with Existing Systems

The dashboard integrates with:
- The A/B testing framework to display test results
- The recommendation engine to show algorithm performance
- The face shape compatibility system to visualize impact on conversions

### Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive and works on all device sizes, from desktop to mobile, ensuring store owners can access insights anywhere.

## Technical Implementation

- **HTML/CSS**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout and styling
- **JavaScript**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Data Handling**: Structured data models for analytics metrics
- **Mock Data**: Sample data for demonstration purposes (to be replaced with real API data in production)

## Future Improvements

While this PR implements a comprehensive analytics dashboard, there are opportunities for further enhancements:

1. **Real-time Data Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live data updates without page refresh
2. **Export Capabilities**: Add functionality to export reports as PDF or CSV
3. **Custom Date Ranges**: Enhance date range selector with custom date picking
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more filtering options for deeper data analysis
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Implement ML-based predictions for future performance

## Testing

The dashboard has been tested with:
- Various screen sizes to ensure responsive design
- Different data scenarios to verify chart rendering
- Edge cases such as no data or incomplete data
- Multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Documentation

Documentation is provided in code comments and includes:
- Chart configuration options
- Data structure requirements
- Integration points with other systems
