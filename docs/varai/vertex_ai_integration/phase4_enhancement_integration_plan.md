   - Create ROI metrics for different knowledge categories

2. **Predictive Conversion Modeling:**
   - Build predictive models for conversion likelihood based on knowledge delivery
   - Implement real-time optimization of knowledge selection
   - Create automated reports on knowledge effectiveness

3. **Multi-touch Attribution:**
   - Develop attribution models for knowledge contribution to sales
   - Implement tracking across conversation sessions and channels
   - Create performance metrics for knowledge engineering investments

## MediaPipe Face Shape Analysis Integration

### Overview of Existing MediaPipe Application

The application at D:\try-me-nextJS is a Next.js application that leverages MediaPipe for face mesh detection and analysis through the user's webcam. This technology:

1. Activates the user's webcam
2. Uses MediaPipe to detect facial landmarks (face mesh)
3. Analyzes these landmarks to determine face shape classification
4. Can potentially provide real-time feedback

### Integration Strategy

#### 1. Architecture Integration

**Server-Side Components:**

   - Create side-by-side comparison view for different recommended frames

#### 3. Technical Requirements

1. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Ensure MediaPipe functions across major browsers
   - Implement fallbacks for browsers with limited WebRTC support
   - Optimize performance for mobile devices

2. **Privacy Considerations:**
