### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Maintaining Dialogflow CX for specialized domain handlers while incorporating Vertex AI for general shopping capabilities.

2. **Cloud-Based Multi-Tenant Design**: Architecture optimized for a multi-tenant environment with appropriate isolation and scalability.

3. **Intent-Based Routing**: Intelligent router determines whether to use Vertex AI, Dialogflow CX, or direct domain handlers based on user intent.

4. **Centralized Context Management**: Unified context management ensures consistent user experience across different subsystems.

5. **Bi-Directional Product Sync**: Real-time synchronization between Shopify product catalog and ML systems.

## Integration Components

### 1. Intent Router

The Intent Router analyzes user messages to determine the most appropriate subsystem to handle the request:

- **General Shopping Queries**: Route to Vertex AI (browsing, cart management, general product search)
- **Specialized Eyewear Consultation**: Route to Dialogflow CX or direct domain handlers
- **Hybrid Cases**: Coordinate response generation across systems

Key capabilities:
- Intent classification with eyewear-specific terminology understanding
- Context-aware routing decisions
- Hybrid response orchestration

### 2. Dialogflow CX Integration

Maintains existing specialized conversation flows:
- Style recommendation flow
- Frame finder flow
- Fit consultation flow

The integration preserves these capabilities while allowing for seamless transition to/from Vertex AI as needed.

### 3. Domain-Specific Handlers

Direct handlers for specialized eyewear needs:
- Style recommendation engine
- Frame finder
- Fit assessment
- Virtual try-on

These handlers integrate with our ML models and provide domain-specific expertise.

### 4. Shopify Integration

Enhanced Shopify integration for the Vertex AI connection:
- Bi-directional sync for product catalog
- Customer profile integration
- Order management connection
- Multi-tenant isolation

### 5. ML Model Integration

Specific integration points for EyewearML's specialized models:
- Facial analysis for frame recommendations
- Style compatibility for personalized suggestions
- Virtual try-on for visual feedback
- Fit prediction for comfort assessment

2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Efficient resource utilization with logical separation
3. **Scalability**: Independent scaling for high-demand tenants
4. **Customization**: Tenant-specific configurations for branding and preferences

See [multi_tenant_design.md](./architecture/multi_tenant_design.md) for detailed specifications.

## Monitoring and Metrics

The integrated system includes comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Conversation Metrics**: Tracking completion rates, abandonment, and satisfaction
2. **Model Performance**: Monitoring accuracy, latency, and resource usage
3. **Business Metrics**: Tracking conversion, AOV, and return rates
4. **System Health**: Monitoring API availability, response times, and error rates

## Security Considerations
