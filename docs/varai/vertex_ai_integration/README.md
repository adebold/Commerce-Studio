# Vertex AI Integration Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for integrating Google's Vertex AI Shopping Assistant with EyewearML's platform. The integration enhances Varai's conversational capabilities while preserving specialized eyewear expertise and leveraging our ML models.

## Documentation Structure

### Implementation Guide

- [MVP Implementation Guide](./mvp_implementation_guide.md) - Overview of the integration architecture, components, and implementation phases

### Agentic Prompts

The following documents provide detailed prompt templates for each specialized agent in the system:

- [Intent Router Agent](./agentic_prompts/intent_router_agent.md) - Routes user queries to appropriate subsystems
- [Domain Expertise Agent](./agentic_prompts/domain_expertise_agent.md) - Enhances responses with eyewear expertise
- [Style Recommendation Agent](./agentic_prompts/style_recommendation_agent.md) - Provides personalized style advice
- [Frame Finder Agent](./agentic_prompts/frame_finder_agent.md) - Helps users find frames matching specific criteria
- [Fit Consultation Agent](./agentic_prompts/fit_consultation_agent.md) - Addresses fit issues and comfort concerns
- [Hybrid Orchestration Agent](./agentic_prompts/hybrid_orchestration_agent.md) - Coordinates responses across multiple subsystems

### Architecture Documents

Detailed technical specifications for implementation:

- [Multi-Tenant Design](./architecture/multi_tenant_design.md) - Architecture for supporting multiple tenants
- [ML Model Integration](./architecture/ml_model_integration.md) - Integration of EyewearML's models with Vertex AI
- [Shopify Integration](./architecture/shopify_integration.md) - E-commerce platform integration details

## Implementation Phases

The integration is divided into four main phases:

1. **Core Integration Setup** (2 weeks)
   - Vertex AI configuration
   - Intent routing mechanism
   - Shopify connector enhancement

2. **ML Model Integration** (3 weeks)
   - Facial analysis integration
   - Style compatibility engine connection
   - Virtual try-on integration

3. **Domain Expertise Injection** (2 weeks)
   - Pre-purchase prompt engineering
   - Response augmentation
   - Hybrid response orchestration

4. **Testing and Optimization** (1 week)
   - Conversation flow testing
   - Performance optimization
   - UI integration finalization

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Intent Routing**: Routes queries between Vertex AI, Dialogflow CX, and domain handlers
- **Domain Knowledge Injection**: Enhances general e-commerce responses with specialized eyewear expertise
- **Style Recommendations**: Provides face shape-aware style guidance
- **Frame Finding**: Searches and filters based on multiple criteria including face shape compatibility
- **Fit Consultation**: Addresses comfort and fit issues with specialized knowledge
- **Hybrid Response Orchestration**: Creates seamless, unified responses from multiple subsystems
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports multiple eyewear retailers with complete isolation
- **Shopify Integration**: Connects to e-commerce platform for product catalog and order management

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. Review the [MVP Implementation Guide](./mvp_implementation_guide.md) for an overview
2. Set up the Vertex AI Shopping Assistant following Google's documentation
3. Implement the Intent Router using the [Intent Router Agent](./agentic_prompts/intent_router_agent.md) prompt
4. Connect to existing ML models following the [ML Model Integration](./architecture/ml_model_integration.md) architecture
5. Enhance Shopify integration according to [Shopify Integration](./architecture/shopify_integration.md)
6. Test with sample conversations covering different agent types

## Deployment Requirements

- Google Cloud Platform account with Vertex AI API access
- Existing Dialogflow CX agents for specialized flows
- Access to EyewearML models via API
- Shopify Partner account (for Shopify integration)
- Multi-tenant capable database and storage

## Contributing

When extending this documentation:

- Add new agentic prompts to the `agentic_prompts` directory
- Place architecture specifications in the `architecture` directory
- Update this README when adding major new sections
- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation
