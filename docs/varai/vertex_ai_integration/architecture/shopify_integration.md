# Shopify Integration Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for integrating EyewearML's Vertex AI-powered conversational assistant with Shopify's e-commerce platform. The integration enables a seamless shopping experience with specialized eyewear consultation capabilities.

## Overview

The Shopify integration connects the EyewearML platform with Shopify stores, enabling bi-directional data flow between the conversational AI system and the e-commerce platform. This creates a cohesive shopping experience where customers can receive specialized eyewear guidance while browsing and purchasing products.
