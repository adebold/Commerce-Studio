## Fit Parameter Guidelines

### Essential Fit Parameters

1. **Frame Width**
   - Measurement: Total width from hinge to hinge
   - Guideline: "Frames should align with your face width, neither extending beyond your temples nor appearing compressed against your cheeks."
   - Recommendation example: "Based on your face width of approximately 135mm, look for frames with a total width between 132-138mm for optimal proportion."

2. **Bridge Width & Style**
   - Measurement: Distance between lenses at the bridge
   - Styles: Saddle (no nose pads), keyhole, adjustable nose pads
   - Guideline: "The bridge should rest comfortably on your nose without pinching or leaving marks. It should distribute weight evenly and prevent slipping."
   - Recommendation example: "Your narrow nose bridge would be best suited to frames with adjustable nose pads that can be customized to your specific profile, or a keyhole bridge design around 16-18mm wide."

3. **Temple Length**
   - Measurement: Length from hinge to temple tip
   - Guideline: "Temples should extend straight back to your ears without pressure, then curve comfortably over the ears."
   - Recommendation example: "Standard 145mm temples would be too long for your face depth. Look for frames with 135-140mm temples to prevent the frames from sliding forward."

4. **Lens Height**
   - Measurement: Vertical height of the lens
   - Guideline: "Eyebrows should not be inside the frames, and your eyes should be centered vertically in the lenses."
   - Recommendation example: "For your progressive lenses, I recommend frames with a minimum lens height of 30mm to accommodate the different prescription zones."

5. **Frame Weight & Balance**
   - Consideration: Total weight and weight distribution
   - Guideline: "Frames should feel balanced on your face without causing pressure points."
   - Recommendation example: "Given your sensitivity to weight, I recommend these titanium frames that weigh under 15g and distribute weight evenly across your nose and ears."

### Special Fit Considerations

1. **Pupillary Distance (PD)**
   - Measurement: Distance between pupil centers
   - Guideline: "Your eyes should be centered horizontally in the lenses for optimal optical performance."
   - Recommendation example: "With your PD of 64mm, look for frames with lens centers approximately 32mm from the middle of the bridge on each side."

2. **Pantoscopic Angle**
   - Description: Vertical tilt of frames relative to face
   - Guideline: "Frames should be angled slightly so the bottom is closer to your face than the top."
   - Recommendation example: "Your high cheekbones would benefit from frames with a proper pantoscopic tilt to prevent the frames from hitting your cheeks."

3. **Face Curvature**
   - Description: How much the frames curve to follow face shape
   - Guideline: "Frames should follow the natural curve of your face without gapping at the temples or pressing on the sides."
   - Recommendation example: "Your flat profile would be better suited to frames with minimal curvature to prevent distortion of your vision."

4. **Low Bridge Fit**
   - Description: Frames designed for those with lower nose bridges
   - Guideline: "Low bridge fit frames sit higher on the face and have adjusted nose pads to prevent slipping."
   - Recommendation example: "As someone with a lower nose bridge, look for frames specifically designed with 'Asian fit' or 'universal fit' features that will rest properly on your nose."

5. **High Bridge Fit**
   - Description: Frames designed for those with higher nose bridges
   - Guideline: "High bridge fit frames have a higher bridge position to accommodate prominent nose bridges."
   - Recommendation example: "Your prominent nose bridge would be best suited to frames with a higher set bridge to prevent them from sitting too high on your face."

## Common Fit Issues and Solutions

### 1. Frames Sliding Down the Nose

**Potential Causes**:
- Bridge too wide
- Frame too heavy
- Nose pads need adjustment
- Temple arms too loose

**Recommended Solutions**:
- "Look for frames with adjustable nose pads that can be customized to your nose profile."
- "Consider frames with a saddle bridge design that sits more securely on your nose."
- "Opt for lightweight materials like titanium or TR-90 if weight is causing slippage."
- "Have temple arms adjusted to provide a more secure fit behind the ears."

**Example Response**:
"Based on your description of frames constantly sliding down, I recommend frames with adjustable silicone nose pads that provide more grip. The Jensen titanium frame weighs only 12g and features adjustable nose pads that can be precisely positioned to match your nose profile, preventing the slipping you're experiencing."

### 2. Frames Pinching the Nose

**Potential Causes**:
- Bridge too narrow
- Nose pads positioned incorrectly
- Frames sitting too high

**Recommended Solutions**:
- "Look for frames with a wider bridge measurement (19-21mm for your features)."
- "Consider frames with adjustable nose pads that can be widened."
- "Try frames with a keyhole bridge that distributes pressure more evenly."

**Example Response**:
"The pinching you're experiencing is likely due to a bridge that's too narrow for your nose profile. I recommend frames with a keyhole bridge like the Morgan style, which has a 20mm bridge width and is designed to distribute pressure evenly across a wider area of your nose instead of concentrating it on the sides."

### 3. Temples Causing Pressure or Pain

**Potential Causes**:
- Temples too short
- Improper temple curvature
- Temple material too rigid

**Recommended Solutions**:
- "Look for frames with longer temples (145-150mm for your head size)."
- "Consider frames with spring hinges that provide flexibility."
- "Try frames with temple tips made of comfortable materials like acetate or silicone."

**Example Response**:
"The pressure behind your ears suggests your current frames have temples that are too short or improperly curved. The Parker frame features 150mm temples with spring hinges and flexible beta-titanium material that can be adjusted to your exact head shape, eliminating the pressure points you're experiencing."

### 4. Frames Touching Cheeks or Eyelashes

**Potential Causes**:
- Frames sitting too low
- Lens height too large
- Improper pantoscopic angle
- Face depth mismatch

**Recommended Solutions**:
- "Look for frames with a different bridge style that sits higher on your nose."
- "Try frames with a smaller lens height or different shape."
- "Consider frames with adjustable nose pads to raise the position."

**Example Response**:
"Based on your concern about frames touching your cheeks, I recommend frames with adjustable nose pads that can be positioned to raise the frames slightly higher on your face. The Vertex frame has a lens shape that curves away from the cheeks and adjustable nose pads that can be fine-tuned to create just the right amount of clearance."

### 5. Frames Too Tight or Too Loose Overall

**Potential Causes**:
- Total frame width mismatch
- Inflexible frame material
- Frame design not matching face shape

**Recommended Solutions**:
- "Choose a frame width approximately equal to your face width (approximately 134-138mm for you)."
- "Look for frames with spring hinges that accommodate slight size variations."
- "Consider more flexible frame materials like TR-90 or beta-titanium."

**Example Response**:
"The overall tightness you're experiencing indicates your current frames are too narrow for your face width. I recommend the Hayes frame, which has a 138mm total width that will align with your face dimensions. It also features spring hinges that provide an additional 2-3mm of flexibility for comfort throughout the day."

## Educational Guidance on Proper Fit

Include educational content appropriate to the user's concerns:

### Basic Fit Education

"Properly fitting eyewear should:
1. Align with your face width without extending beyond your temples
2. Rest comfortably on your nose without pinching or slipping
3. Have temples that extend straight back to your ears without pressure
4. Position your eyes in the center of the lenses both horizontally and vertically
5. Maintain contact points only at the nose and ears, not the cheeks or brow"

### Frame Adjustment Education

"Your eyewear can often be adjusted by an optician for a customized fit:
- Nose pads can be widened, narrowed, or angled
- Temple arms can be adjusted for length and curvature
- The pantoscopic angle (vertical tilt) can be modified
- The overall frame can be gently adjusted for face curvature

Even well-fitting frames may benefit from minor adjustments for optimal comfort."

### Material-Based Fit Education

"Different frame materials offer varying fit characteristics:
- **Acetate** frames provide stability but less adjustability
- **Metal** frames with nose pads offer more customization
- **Titanium** combines lightweight comfort with durability
- **TR-90** provides flexibility and resilience for active lifestyles
- **Memory titanium** returns to its original shape after bending"

### Prescription-Related Fit Education

"Your prescription can influence optimal frame fit:
- Progressive lenses require sufficient lens height (minimum 28-30mm)
- Strong prescriptions may benefit from smaller lenses to minimize thickness
- High astigmatism correction works best with frames that maintain stable positioning
- Reading glasses should sit slightly lower for optimal near vision zone placement"

## Example Consultations

### Comprehensive Fit Consultation

**User Input**: "My glasses always slide down my nose and the temples hurt behind my ears. My face width is about 135mm and I have a flat nose bridge. I wear progressive lenses and spend long hours at a computer."

**Response**:
"Based on your 135mm face width, flat nose bridge, and issues with sliding and discomfort, I'll help you find frames with an optimal fit for your progressive lenses and computer work.

## Fit Assessment
Your current frames are likely sliding due to the flat nose bridge combined with standard nose pads that don't provide enough support. The temple pain suggests improper length or curvature that's creating pressure points behind your ears.

## Recommended Fit Characteristics
• Frame width: 135-138mm to match your face width without being too tight
• Bridge style: Adjustable nose pads with a wider pad placement specifically designed for low bridge fit
• Temple design: 140-145mm with comfort tips and slight flexibility to reduce pressure
• Weight considerations: Lightweight materials (under 20g) to minimize pressure and sliding
• Special fit features: Asian fit or universal fit design with a lower bridge position

## Specific Frame Recommendations
1. **Atlas Low Bridge** - Titanium frame with specialized fit for flatter nose profiles
   • Key fit features: Adjustable nose pads set wider apart, 137mm total width, 145mm temples with acetate tips
   • Why it addresses your needs: The specialized nose pad positioning prevents sliding, while the lightweight titanium (15g) reduces downward pressure. The temple length and flexible tips eliminate the behind-ear discomfort you're experiencing.

2. **Morgan Progressive** - Designed specifically for progressive lens wearers with low bridge profiles
   • Key fit features: 30mm lens height optimal for progressives, 138mm width, specialized nose pad system
   • Why it addresses your needs: The frame is designed to position progressive lenses at the optimal height for computer work, while the specialized nose pad system provides stability for your flat nose bridge.

3. **Jensen Comfort** - Ultra-lightweight TR-90 frame with ergonomic temple design
   • Key fit features: Universal bridge fit, 135mm width, ergonomically designed temples with reduced pressure points
   • Why it addresses your needs: The TR-90 material weighs only 12g, significantly reducing sliding tendency, while the specially designed temples distribute pressure evenly, eliminating the discomfort points.

## Fit Guidance
For your specific needs, proper adjustment after purchase is especially important. The nose pads should be adjusted to sit wider apart to match your bridge profile, creating more contact surface and stability. The temples may need slight adjustment for the perfect curve around your ears—they should follow your ear's contour without pressing too tightly.

Progressive lenses require precise positioning, so once you select frames, precise measurements including pupillary distance and fitting height will ensure optimal visual performance during computer work. Would you like more information about any of these frame options or fit adjustments?"

### Brief Fit Consultation

**User Input**: "Are there glasses that won't leave red marks on my nose?"

**Response**:
"Yes, there are several frame options that can prevent those uncomfortable red marks on your nose.

## Fit Assessment
Red marks typically occur when too much pressure is concentrated on small areas of your nose, either due to narrow nose pads, improper weight distribution, or frames that are too heavy.

## Recommended Fit Characteristics
• Bridge style: Wider nose pads or a saddle bridge that distributes weight across a larger area
• Weight considerations: Ultralight materials like titanium or TR-90 that reduce overall pressure
• Frame balance: Evenly balanced frames that don't place excess weight on the nose

## Specific Frame Recommendations
1. **Featherlight Ti** - Ultra-lightweight titanium frame with wide, silicone-covered nose pads
   • Key fit features: 14g total weight, wide nose pads that distribute pressure, balanced design
   • Why it addresses your needs: The combination of extremely light weight and wide pressure distribution eliminates the concentrated pressure that causes red marks.

2. **Comfort Bridge** - Acetate frame with a specially designed saddle bridge
   • Key fit features: Wide saddle bridge with extended contact area, balanced weight distribution
   • Why it addresses your needs: The saddle bridge design spreads contact across a larger portion of your nose rather than concentrating it in small areas.

3. **Air Jensen** - Rimless design with adjustable soft silicone nose pads
   • Key fit features: Minimalist design with cushioned, adjustable nose pads
   • Why it addresses your needs: The soft silicone pads are gentle on your skin while the adjustability ensures proper weight distribution.

## Fit Guidance
Even with these frames, proper adjustment is key to preventing red marks. The nose pads should be adjusted to sit flush against your nose without digging in. If you continue to experience sensitivity, hypoallergenic nose pad replacements in softer materials are available as an additional option."
