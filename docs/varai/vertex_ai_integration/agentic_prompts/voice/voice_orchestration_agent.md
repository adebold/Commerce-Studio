# Voice Orchestration Agent

## Purpose

The Voice Orchestration Agent coordinates all voice interaction components, managing the flow between speech recognition, AI processing, and speech synthesis. This agent ensures a seamless bidirectional conversation experience and handles transitions between voice and text modalities.

## Input

- User interaction mode preferences
- Speech recognition results
- Vertex AI system responses
- Tenant configuration
- Session state
- Device capabilities
- Conversation context

## Output

- Orchestration commands to other agents
- Mode transition signals
- Turn-taking control signals
- Error recovery directives
- Analytics events

## Core Functions

1. **Conversation Flow Management**
   - Control turn-taking between user and system
   - Manage interruptions and overlapping speech
   - Provide conversational continuity across mode switches
   - Implement appropriate timing for responses

2. **Modality Coordination**
   - Seamlessly transition between voice and text interactions
   - Combine multimodal inputs (voice + webcam)
   - Coordinate voice with visual elements
   - Switch modalities based on context or errors

3. **Session Management**
   - Initialize voice components at session start
   - Maintain state across interaction segments
   - Handle timeouts and session resumption
   - Gracefully close voice resources at session end

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Pre-load likely responses for faster synthesis
   - Manage resource allocation across voice components
   - Implement progressive enhancement based on capabilities
   - Apply adaptive strategies based on connection quality

## Decision-Making Guidelines

When orchestrating voice interactions, the agent should:

1. **Prioritize response time** for simple acknowledgments
2. **Extend listening time** when context suggests a complex query
3. **Smoothly interrupt** when high-confidence corrections are needed
4. **Fall back to text** when voice interactions repeatedly fail
5. **Adapt pacing** to match user's conversational style

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Standard Voice Conversation

**User**: Activates voice and asks "What styles would look good on me?"

**Orchestration**:
1. Signal Speech Recognition Agent to activate
2. Process recognized text via Intent Router
3. Receive text response from Style Recommendation Handler
4. Signal Speech Synthesis Agent to generate audio
5. Manage turn-taking with visual cues
6. Prepare for next user input

**System Voice**: "To recommend styles that would look best on you, I'd need to know your face shape. Would you like to use our webcam analysis to determine your face shape?"

### Example 2: Multimodal Interaction

**User**: Responds "Yes" to webcam analysis offer

**Orchestration**:
1. Process short affirmative response
2. Coordinate transition to webcam interface
3. Provide voice guidance during face analysis
4. Process face shape results into conversation context
5. Signal re-engagement of voice interface after analysis
6. Request style recommendations with enhanced context

**System Voice**: "Great! I can see you have a heart-shaped face. For heart-shaped faces, I recommend frames that are wider at the top than bottom, like aviators or cat-eye frames. Would you like to see some examples?"

## Integration Requirements

- Bidirectional communication with all voice agents
- Access to intent routing system
- Connection to tenant configuration
- Access to device capability detection
- Real-time analytics integration
- Session state management

## Error Recovery Strategies

| Error Type | Detection Method | Recovery Action |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Voice activation failure | Timeout after prompt | Fall back to text input with clear notification |
| Component synchronization error | State mismatch between agents | Reset conversation turn and reinitialize components |
| Voice quality degradation | Metrics from speech agents | Switch to more resilient voice mode or suggest text |
| Context loss | Missing expected context variables | Re-establish context through explicit questions |
| Device permission issues | API permission errors | Guide user through enabling necessary permissions |

## Implementation Considerations

### Conversation State Management

The Voice Orchestration Agent maintains a state machine for each conversation:

```
┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐
│               │         │               │         │               │

└───────────────┘         └───────────────┘         └───────────────┘
```

### Voice + Face Analysis Integration Flow

The orchestration process for face analysis with voice guidance:

1. Detect face analysis intent from voice query
2. Confirm user willingness to proceed
3. Transition to webcam interface with voice introduction
4. Coordinate voice instructions with visual positioning guidance
5. Provide verbal feedback during analysis
6. Announce completion and summarize results verbally
7. Transition back to recommendation flow with enhanced context

### Device Capability Detection

Before initiating voice interactions, the agent should:

1. Check microphone availability and permissions
2. Test audio output capabilities
3. Determine browser compatibility with chosen APIs
4. Measure available bandwidth for streaming
5. Detect CPU/memory constraints for local processing

### Handling Interruptions

The agent implements these interruption strategies:

1. **Continuous listening**: Monitor for interruptions during system speech
2. **Early termination**: Gracefully stop current utterance when interrupted
3. **Context preservation**: Maintain awareness of interrupted content
4. **Resumption offers**: When appropriate, offer to continue interrupted explanations
5. **Barge-in thresholds**: Adjust sensitivity based on content importance

## Technical Architecture

The Voice Orchestration Agent serves as the coordination layer between voice components:

```

## Monitoring and Analytics

The agent collects these key metrics:

1. Modality switch frequency (voice ↔ text)
2. Turn-taking latency
3. Conversation abandonment rates
4. Error recovery success rates
5. Cross-modal continuity measures
6. Interruption frequency and handling
7. Session duration by modality

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. Maintain consistent permission handling across modalities
2. Provide clear status indicators for active listening
3. Apply same data retention policies to all modalities
4. Ensure graceful fallbacks preserve privacy
5. Log all modality transitions for audit purposes
