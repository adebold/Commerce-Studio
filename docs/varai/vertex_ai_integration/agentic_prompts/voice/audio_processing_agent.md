# Audio Processing Agent

## Purpose

The Audio Processing Agent handles the technical aspects of audio signal processing for both input and output speech. This agent ensures optimal audio quality, manages background noise, handles interruptions, and provides adaptive processing based on environment and device characteristics.

## Input

- Raw audio input stream from user microphone
- Device audio capabilities
- Environmental audio characteristics
- Tenant audio processing configuration
- Session state and history
- Previous audio processing results

## Output

- Processed audio for speech recognition
- Audio quality metrics
- Environment classification
- Interruption detection signals
- Audio processing parameter adjustments

## Core Functions

1. **Input Audio Enhancement**
   - Noise reduction and cancellation
   - Voice activity detection
   - Signal amplification and normalization
   - Echo cancellation
   - Environmental adaptation

2. **Output Audio Optimization**
   - Dynamic range compression
   - Output level normalization
   - Device-specific equalization
   - Buffer management for smooth playback
   - Adaptive volume control

3. **Interruption Management**
   - Detect user speech during system output
   - Identify intentional vs. accidental interruptions
   - Manage barge-in behavior appropriately
   - Provide graceful cutoff and resumption

4. **Environmental Adaptation**
   - Classify environment (quiet, noisy, very noisy)
   - Detect and adapt to ambient noise changes
   - Optimize processing for different devices
   - Adjust strategies based on connection quality

## Decision-Making Guidelines

When processing audio, the agent should:

1. **Balance noise reduction and voice detail preservation**
2. **Adapt processing intensity** based on environmental conditions
3. **Prioritize detection of speech** over perfect audio quality
4. **Minimize processing latency** for natural conversation
5. **Apply appropriate interruption thresholds** based on conversation phase

## Technical Implementation Details

### Input Processing Pipeline:

```
Raw Audio → Noise Estimation → Voice Activity Detection → 
Noise Reduction → Normalization → Echo Cancellation → 
Equalization → Output to Speech Recognition
```

### Output Processing Pipeline:

```
Synthesized Audio → Normalization → Dynamic Range Compression → 
Device-specific Equalization → Volume Adjustment → 
Buffer Management → Output to Audio System
```

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Noisy Environment

**Detected Condition**: High ambient noise (coffee shop)

**Processing Actions**:
1. Increase noise reduction intensity
2. Tighten voice activity detection thresholds
3. Apply more aggressive band-pass filtering
4. Increase required interruption volume threshold
5. Suggest to user that text input might be more reliable

**Adaptation Result**: Clean speech signal despite challenging environment, with appropriate expectations management

### Example 2: Device Limitations

**Detected Condition**: Poor microphone quality on user device

**Processing Actions**:
1. Apply more conservative noise reduction to prevent artifacts
2. Focus on preserving mid-range frequencies
3. Increase speech recognition confidence thresholds
4. Adjust output to compensate for device speaker limitations
5. Monitor for improvements or degradation

**Adaptation Result**: Maximized usability within device constraints

## Integration Requirements

- Low-level access to audio input/output streams
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Device capability detection
- Environmental analysis algorithms
- Connection to Voice Orchestration Agent
- Performance monitoring and adaptation mechanisms

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target Range | Adaptation Threshold |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Input latency | <50ms | >100ms |
| Signal-to-noise ratio | >15dB | <10dB |
| Speech detection accuracy | >95% | <85% |
| Interruption detection time | <300ms | >500ms |
| Output buffer underruns | 0 | Any |

## Implementation Considerations

### Browser Audio Processing

For web implementations, leverage the Web Audio API:

```javascript
// Example of setting up audio processing
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const microphoneStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({audio: true});
const microphoneSource = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(microphoneStream);
const processorNode = audioContext.createScriptProcessor(1024, 1, 1);

// Apply audio processing
processorNode.onaudioprocess = (event) => {
  const inputData = event.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
  const outputData = event.outputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
  
  // Apply noise reduction
  applyNoiseReduction(inputData, outputData);
  
  // Detect voice activity
  const isSpeaking = detectVoiceActivity(inputData);
  
  // Pass to speech recognition if voice detected
  if (isSpeaking) {
    sendToSpeechRecognition(outputData);
  }
};

microphoneSource.connect(processorNode);
processorNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
```

### Mobile Device Optimization

When running on mobile devices:

1. Implement battery-aware processing levels
2. Utilize device-specific audio profiles
3. Handle audio interruptions (calls, notifications)
4. Adapt to changing network conditions
5. Consider background processing limitations

### Face Analysis Integration Considerations

During face analysis sessions:

1. Reduce audio processing during high CPU usage phases
2. Prioritize microphone access for voice commands
3. Handle potential echo from face analysis guidance
4. Manage transition between voice-only and multimodal states
5. Apply speech detection bias toward expected commands

## Advanced Techniques

### Adaptive Noise Filtering

The agent can apply machine learning-based noise filtering:

1. Train on common eyewear retail environments
2. Distinguish between background conversations and target speech
3. Adapt filter parameters based on detected environment
4. Apply temporal smoothing to avoid jarring transitions
5. Continuously learn from successful recognition outcomes

### Voice Biometrics (Optional)

For enhanced security and personalization:

1. Create lightweight voice print during initial interaction
2. Verify user identity in subsequent interactions
3. Adapt processing to user-specific speech characteristics
4. Maintain voice profiles with appropriate privacy controls
5. Use only as an enhancement, not a security requirement

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. Process audio locally when possible
2. Clearly indicate when audio processing is active
3. Provide processing settings transparency
4. Do not store raw audio data beyond necessary processing time
5. Comply with regulatory requirements for biometric data if used
6. Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
