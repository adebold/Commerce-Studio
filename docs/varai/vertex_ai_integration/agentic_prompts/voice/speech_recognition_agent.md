# Speech Recognition Agent

## Purpose

The Speech Recognition Agent is responsible for converting user speech input into accurate text representations for processing by the Vertex AI system. This agent handles various aspects of speech-to-text conversion including activation, processing, error correction, and context management.

## Input

- Audio stream from user microphone
- Conversation context including:
  - Session ID
  - User ID
  - Tenant ID
  - Conversation history
  - Current domain context (e.g., frame recommendation, fit consultation)
- Voice configuration settings

## Output

- Transcribed text
- Confidence scores per word/phrase
- Metadata including:
  - Processing time
  - Audio quality metrics
  - Detected language
  - Speaker characteristics
  - Potential alternative interpretations

## Core Functions

1. **Activation Management**
   - Handle explicit activation (button press)
   - Process wake word detection
   - Manage continuous listening mode
   - Provide visual and audio cues for activation state

2. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - Connect to appropriate STT API based on tenant configuration
   - Stream audio for real-time processing
   - Apply domain-specific vocabulary enhancement
   - Filter background noise and non-speech audio

3. **Context-Aware Interpretation**
   - Apply domain-specific language models for eyewear terminology
   - Use conversation history to improve interpretation accuracy
   - Maintain context between speech segments

4. **Error Handling**
   - Detect low confidence transcriptions
   - Prompt for clarification when needed
   - Fallback to text input when speech recognition fails
   - Handle network interruptions gracefully

## Decision-Making Guidelines

When determining how to process speech input, the agent should:

1. **Prioritize accuracy over speed** for critical information (e.g., prescription details)
2. **Use context to disambiguate** similar-sounding eyewear terms
3. **Apply confidence thresholds** appropriate to the current conversation state
4. **Balance interruptions and corrections** to maintain natural conversation flow
5. **Adapt to user speech patterns** over the course of a session

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Basic Query

**User Audio**: "Show me some round frames for my face shape"

**Processing**:
1. Activate on button press or wake word
2. Stream audio to selected STT service
3. Apply eyewear domain vocabulary
4. Detect "round frames" as a product category
5. Identify "face shape" as a context reference

**Output Text**: "Show me some round frames for my face shape"
**Confidence**: 0.92
**Context Enhancement**: {product_category: "round frames", context_reference: "face shape"}

### Example 2: Handling Ambiguity

**User Audio**: "I want something similar to way fair" (user means "Wayfarer" style)

**Processing**:
1. Initial transcription: "I want something similar to way fair"
2. Detect low confidence (0.76) on "way fair"
3. Apply eyewear brand/style dictionary
4. Correct to likely eyewear term

**Output Text**: "I want something similar to Wayfarer"
**Confidence**: 0.88 (after correction)
**Alternative Interpretations**: ["way fair", "wayfare", "wayfarer"]

## Integration Requirements

- Access to audio input stream from web/mobile interfaces
- API credentials for supported STT services
- Connection to tenant configuration service
- Real-time bidirectional communication with Voice Orchestration Agent
- Access to domain-specific vocabulary for eyewear terms

## Error Recovery Strategies

| Error Type | Detection Method | Recovery Action |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Low audio quality | Signal-to-noise ratio measurement | Prompt user to speak louder or reduce background noise |
| Ambiguous terms | Low confidence score on specific words | Present options with likely alternatives |
| Unknown terminology | Missing from domain vocabulary | Request clarification through text or voice |
| Connection failure | API timeout or error response | Fallback to local processing or text input |
| Continuous errors | Multiple failed interpretation attempts | Suggest switching to text input mode |

## Implementation Considerations

### Domain-Specific Vocabulary

The Speech Recognition Agent should be enhanced with eyewear-specific terminology, including:

- Frame styles (aviator, cat-eye, rectangular, round, wayfarer, etc.)
- Eyewear brands
- Lens types (single vision, progressive, bifocal, etc.)
- Frame materials (acetate, titanium, memory metal, etc.)
- Facial features relevant to eyewear
- Common prescription terminology

### Handling Integration with Face Analysis

When the user is engaged in a face analysis session:

1. Listen for specific commands related to the analysis process
2. Recognize confirmation phrases ("yes", "okay", "let's do it")
3. Detect position adjustment phrases ("how's this?", "is this better?")
4. Recognize queries about the analysis process

### Performance Optimization

To maintain responsive voice interactions:

1. Use streaming recognition where possible
2. Implement early endpoint detection for common phrases
3. Maintain persistent connections to STT services
4. Pre-cache domain-specific models based on conversation flow
5. Adaptively adjust processing based on network conditions

## Technical Implementation Options

| Capability | Web Speech API | Google Cloud STT | NVIDIA Riva | Amazon Transcribe |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Browser support | Native | Via API | Via API | Via API |
| Streaming | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Custom vocabulary | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-language | Yes | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Wake word | No | No | Yes | Limited |
| Offline capability | Limited | No | Optional | No |
| Pricing | Free | Pay per minute | Custom | Pay per minute |

## Monitoring and Analytics

The agent should collect these metrics for performance analysis:

1. Recognition accuracy rate
2. Processing latency
3. Fallback frequency
4. Domain term recognition rates
5. User correction frequency
6. API usage by provider
7. Activation success rate

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. Clearly indicate when microphone is active
2. Process audio locally when possible
3. Do not store raw audio data
4. Transmit audio over secure connections only
5. Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
6. Adhere to tenant-specific data handling policies
