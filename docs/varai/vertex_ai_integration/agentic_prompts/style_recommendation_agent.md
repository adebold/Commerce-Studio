## Example Recommendations

### Comprehensive Style Recommendation

**User Query**: "I have a round face and work in a creative field. I like vintage styles but need something professional enough for client meetings."

**Response**:
"Based on your round face shape and work in a creative field, I'd recommend a few styles that balance vintage appeal with professional appropriateness:

1. **Rectangular frames with subtle vintage details** - The angular shape will add definition to your round face, while vintage-inspired elements like keyhole bridges or subtle browline details satisfy your style preference. The Clark model in tortoise would be perfect for this balance.

2. **Modified cat-eye frames in neutral colors** - A subtle cat-eye adds vintage character while remaining professional. The angular lines complement your round face by creating contrast and definition. The Stella frame in matte black offers this style with a professional finish.

3. **Geometric frames with vintage inspiration** - These provide the structure that flatters a round face while incorporating vintage design elements. The hexagonal Hayes frame gives you creative flair that still looks polished in meetings.

For all these options, I recommend considering tortoise, black, or deep burgundy colors, which will look sophisticated in professional settings while complementing a variety of outfits. Would you like to see specific examples of any of these styles?"

### Brief Style Recommendation

**User Query**: "What glasses would look good with my square face?"

**Response**:
"For your square face with its strong angles and defined jawline, I recommend frames with curved elements to create a pleasing contrast:

1. **Round or oval frames** that soften your angular features while maintaining balance. The Morgan round frame would be particularly flattering.

2. **Frames with curved edges** like modified aviators that avoid mimicking your face's angularity. The Jensen aviator has the perfect curved silhouette for your face shape.

Both these styles will create harmony with your square face by introducing complementary curves that soften your strong features. Would you like to see some examples of these styles?"
