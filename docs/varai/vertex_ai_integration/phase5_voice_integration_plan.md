## Overview

Phase 5 adds voice interaction capabilities to the EyewearML platform, enabling users to engage with the system using natural speech instead of or in addition to text. The implementation includes both speech recognition (converting user speech to text) and speech synthesis (converting system responses to spoken output), along with sophisticated voice persona customization and optional avatar integration.

### Key Objectives

1. Create an intuitive voice-based interaction experience
2. Maintain consistent brand identity through voice persona customization
3. Ensure seamless integration with existing features, particularly face analysis
4. Support multi-tenant voice configuration
5. Implement robust voice analytics and quality monitoring
6. Ensure accessibility compliance across all interfaces

## Architecture

The voice interaction system follows the same agent-based architecture as the core system, with specialized agents handling different aspects of voice processing:

## Technical Components

### 1. Speech Recognition Agent

The Speech Recognition Agent handles all aspects of converting user speech to text:

- **Input management**: Activation, capture, and streaming
- **Recognition processing**: API selection, audio processing, confidence scoring
- **Error handling**: Recovery from recognition failures, ambiguity resolution
- **Context integration**: Domain-specific vocabulary enhancement

Implementation details and agent prompts are described in [speech_recognition_agent.md](./agentic_prompts/voice/speech_recognition_agent.md).

### 2. Speech Synthesis Agent

The Speech Synthesis Agent converts system text responses into natural-sounding speech:

- **Text preprocessing**: Format optimization, pronunciation correction, emphasis markup
- **Voice selection**: Tenant-specific voice characteristics
- **Speech generation**: API integration, parameter management, streaming
- **Output control**: Playback management, interruption handling

Implementation details and agent prompts are described in [speech_synthesis_agent.md](./agentic_prompts/voice/speech_synthesis_agent.md).

### 3. Voice Orchestration Agent

The Voice Orchestration Agent coordinates the entire voice interaction flow:

- **Turn management**: Controlling conversation flow between user and system
- **Mode transitions**: Seamlessly switching between voice and text when appropriate
- **Session control**: Initializing and managing voice session state
- **Performance optimization**: Resource allocation and response time management

Implementation details and agent prompts are described in [voice_orchestration_agent.md](./agentic_prompts/voice/voice_orchestration_agent.md).

### 4. Voice Persona Agent
