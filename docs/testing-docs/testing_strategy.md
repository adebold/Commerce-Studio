# ML Monitoring System Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for our ML monitoring system, establishing standards and best practices to ensure reliability and correctness.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach for the ML monitoring system is guided by the following principles:

- **Reliability First**: The monitoring system is a critical infrastructure component that other systems depend on. Our tests must ensure high reliability and correctness.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of testing provide overlapping coverage to catch issues that might slip through a single test layer.
- **Data-centric**: Many issues in ML monitoring relate to data handling, so our tests must thoroughly verify data transformations, storage, and retrieval.
- **Production-like Testing**: Tests should mirror production conditions where possible, including realistic data volumes, timing patterns, and error conditions.
- **Automation**: Tests should be automated to run consistently and frequently, providing rapid feedback to developers.
- **Shift Left**: Testing should occur early and throughout the development process, not just at the end.

## 2. Test Types

We will implement the following types of tests:

### 2.1 Unit Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify the behavior of individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation.
- **Scope**: All core components, including metrics, storage backends, alerting mechanisms, dashboard components, and API endpoints.
- **Tools**: pytest as the primary testing framework, with pytest-mock for mocking dependencies.
- **Isolation**: Dependencies should be mocked or stubbed to ensure true unit testing.

### 2.2 Integration Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that components work together correctly.
- **Scope**: Interactions between subsystems, such as metric collection → storage → alerting → dashboard generation.
- **Data Flow**: Focus on data passing correctly between components.
- **Environment**: Use test fixtures that simulate a complete system.

### 2.3 Functional Tests

- **Purpose**: Verify that the system meets functional requirements.
- **Scope**: End-to-end workflows from the user/client perspective.
- **API Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the REST API.
- **Tools**: FastAPI TestClient for API testing.

### 2.4 Performance Tests

- **Purpose**: Ensure the system meets performance requirements under expected load.
- **Types**:
  - **Load Testing**: Verify behavior under expected production load.
  - **Stress Testing**: Determine breaking points under extreme conditions.
  - **Soak Testing**: Ensure stability over extended periods.
- **Metrics**: Monitor throughput, latency, resource usage, and error rates.
- **Tools**: Locust or k6 for load testing.

### 2.5 Reliability Tests

- **Purpose**: Ensure the system operates correctly under adverse conditions.
- **Chaos Testing**: Inject faults to verify system resilience.
- **Recovery Testing**: Verify system can recover from failures.
- **Tools**: Chaos engineering principles applied to our test environments.

## 3. Coverage Standards

### 3.1 Code Coverage

- **Minimum Coverage**: 85% statement coverage for all modules.
- **Target Coverage**: 95% for critical paths in metrics, storage, and alerting modules.
- **Measurement**: Use pytest-cov to measure and report coverage.
- **CI Integration**: Enforce coverage thresholds in CI pipeline.

### 3.2 Functional Coverage

- All API endpoints must have test coverage for:
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases
  - Authentication/authorization (once implemented)
- All metric types must have test coverage for creation, validation, serialization, and deserialization.
- All storage backends must have test coverage for CRUD operations, queries, and retention policies.
- All alert rules must have test coverage for trigger conditions, notification sending, and cooldown periods.

### 3.3 Edge Case Coverage

Tests must explicitly cover:
- Empty inputs
- Invalid inputs
- Boundary conditions
- Race conditions in concurrent operations
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Network failures and timeouts
- Data corruption scenarios

## 4. Test Organization and Naming

### 4.1 Directory Structure

```
src/tests/
├── unit/                      # Unit tests
│   ├── monitoring/            # Matches source directory structure
│   │   ├── test_metrics.py    
│   │   ├── test_storage.py    
│   │   ├── test_alerts.py     
│   │   ├── test_dashboard.py  
│   │   └── test_api.py        
├── integration/               # Integration tests
│   ├── test_metric_storage.py
│   ├── test_alerting.py
│   └── test_dashboards.py
├── functional/                # Functional tests
│   └── test_api_workflows.py
├── performance/               # Performance tests
│   ├── test_metric_throughput.py
│   └── test_query_performance.py
├── conftest.py                # Shared test fixtures
└── test_data/                 # Test data files
```

### 4.2 Test Naming Conventions

- Test files: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test classes: `Test<ComponentName>`
- Test methods: `test_<behavior>_<condition>`, e.g. `test_store_metric_duplicate_id`
- Parameterized tests: Include descriptive parameter names

### 4.3 Test Fixtures

- Define reusable fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Scope fixtures appropriately (function, class, module, session)
- Clearly document fixture purposes and dependencies
- Use factory fixtures for flexible test data creation

## 5. Testing Tools and Frameworks

### 5.1 Primary Testing Frameworks

- **pytest**: Main testing framework
- **pytest-mock**: For mocking dependencies
- **pytest-cov**: For code coverage measurement
- **pytest-xdist**: For parallel test execution

### 5.2 Additional Testing Tools

- **FastAPI TestClient**: For API testing
- **Locust/k6**: For load testing
- **pytest-benchmark**: For performance benchmarking
- **hypothesis**: For property-based testing of complex components

### 5.3 Mocking Strategies

- Use pytest-mock for mocking
- Create custom fixtures for complex dependencies
- Use appropriate scope for mocks to avoid test interference
- Mock external services (databases, APIs) for unit and most integration tests

## 6. Test Data Management

### 6.1 Test Data Sources

- **Generated Data**: Programmatically generated test data for most tests
- **Fixed Datasets**: Version-controlled reference datasets for complex scenarios
- **Production-like Data**: Anonymized production-like data for performance testing

### 6.2 Test Data Guidelines

- Test data should be reproducible and deterministic
- Tests should clean up after themselves
- Test data volume should match the purpose (small for unit tests, large for performance tests)
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions in test data

## 7. Testing Workflows

### 7.1 Local Development

- Run relevant tests during development (`pytest path/to/test`)
- Run all unit tests before committing (`pytest src/tests/unit`)
- Fix test failures before pushing code

### 7.2 Continuous Integration

- Run unit and integration tests on all PRs
- Run functional tests on merge to main branch
- Run performance tests nightly on main branch
- Generate and archive test reports
- Track code coverage trends

### 7.3 Release Testing

- Run full test suite before releases
- Perform additional manual verification if needed
- Validate in staging environment before production

## 8. Test Implementation Standards

### 8.1 Test Structure

- Use the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Clearly separate setup, execution, and verification
- Use descriptive assertion messages

### 8.2 Test Independence

- Tests should be independent and self-contained
- Avoid dependencies between tests
- Reset state between tests

### 8.3 Test Readability

- Tests should be clear and self-documenting
- Use descriptive variable names
- Comment complex test logic

### 8.4 Test Maintenance

- Refactor tests when the implementation changes
- Keep tests updated with API changes
- Regularly review test coverage and quality

## 9. Special Considerations for ML Monitoring

### 9.1 Time-dependent Testing

- Use time freezing techniques for tests involving timestamps
- Test time-window calculations explicitly
- Verify correct timezone handling

### 9.2 Stateful Component Testing

- Design tests to verify correct state transitions
- Test retention policies and data aging
- Verify thread safety in concurrent operations

### 9.3 Alert Testing

- Test alert rules with various threshold configurations

- Mock notification channels to verify correct content

## 10. Success Criteria

The testing strategy will be considered successful when:

1. Test coverage meets or exceeds the defined thresholds
2. CI pipeline runs tests automatically on code changes
3. Tests catch bugs before they reach production
4. The ML monitoring system operates reliably in production
5. Developers can run tests easily during development

## 11. Implementation Timeline

1. Set up basic test infrastructure and CI integration (Week 1)
2. Implement unit tests for core components (Weeks 1-2)
3. Implement integration tests for workflows (Week 3)
4. Implement performance and load tests (Weeks 3-4)
5. Continuously refine and expand tests as the system evolves
