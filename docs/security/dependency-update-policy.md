# Dependency Management Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the official policy for managing dependencies across the EyewearML platform. Following these guidelines helps ensure that our application remains secure, stable, and maintainable.

## Principles

1. **Security First**: Security vulnerabilities must be addressed promptly according to severity.
2. **Stability**: Updates should not break existing functionality.
3. **Maintainability**: Dependencies should be kept current to facilitate future development.
4. **Documentation**: All dependency decisions must be documented.

## Update Schedule

| Update Type | Frequency | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Security Patches | Immediate | Critical security vulnerabilities must be addressed as soon as possible. |
| Minor Version Updates | Monthly | Regular updates that don't introduce breaking changes. |
| Major Version Updates | Quarterly | Updates that may include breaking changes and require more extensive testing. |
| Full Dependency Audit | Quarterly | Comprehensive review of all dependencies using dependency-audit.js. |

## Workflow

### Regular Updates

1. Run `npm run update-deps` to update minor versions.
2. Run automated tests to ensure compatibility.
3. Document any issues encountered.
4. Commit and deploy updates.

### Major Updates

1. Create a dedicated branch for the update.
2. Run `npm run update-deps:major` to identify major version updates.
3. Update dependencies individually or in related groups.
4. Test extensively in development and staging environments.
5. Document breaking changes and required code modifications.
6. Merge and deploy after thorough review.

### Security Vulnerability Response

1. Assess vulnerability severity:
   - Critical/High: Address within 24 hours
   - Moderate: Address within 1 week
   - Low: Address during next update cycle
2. Determine best approach:
   - Update the vulnerable package
   - Apply a patch
   - Implement a workaround
   - Accept the risk (requires exception documentation)
3. Test the solution thoroughly.
4. Deploy the fix.
5. Update security documentation.

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| npm audit | Identify security vulnerabilities | `npm audit` |
| npm outdated | Identify outdated packages | `npm outdated` |
| dependency-audit.js | Generate comprehensive audit reports | Run quarterly or as needed |
| npm-check-updates | Identify and update packages to latest versions | Used with update-deps:major script |

## Exception Management

Some vulnerabilities may need to be temporarily accepted due to constraints. In such cases:

1. Document the exception in `docs/security/dependency-exceptions.md`
2. Include risk assessment, mitigation strategy, and timeline for resolution
3. Get approval from the CTO and Security Lead
4. Review exceptions quarterly to ensure they're still valid

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Engineering Team | Regular updates, testing, implementation |
| CTO | Approval of major updates and exceptions |
| Security Lead | Review of security implications, prioritization of vulnerabilities |
| DevOps | Deployment of updates, maintenance of CI/CD pipeline |
