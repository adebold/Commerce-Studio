## Notes

Use this section to document any exceptions, mitigations, or additional information.

### Automated Security Findings Addressed (2025-05-21)
- All dependency versions in requirements.txt have been pinned to specific versions as recommended by the Safety check
- Verified that there are no assert statements in production code (only in test files, which is appropriate)
- Verified that there are no try-except-pass patterns in the codebase
- All high and medium severity security vulnerabilities have been fixed
- Low severity issues have been addressed

Note: Manual verification steps in this checklist still need to be completed by the security team.
