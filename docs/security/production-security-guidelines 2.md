# EyewearML Production Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices for the EyewearML platform in production.

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- [x] Use secure, randomly generated secret keys for JWT signing
- [x] Implement short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- [x] Use refresh tokens with longer expiration (7 days)
- [x] Store tokens securely (HTTP-only cookies, secure storage)
- [x] Implement token revocation mechanism
- [ ] Set up multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [x] Define clear roles with least privilege principle
- [x] Implement permission checks on all sensitive endpoints
- [x] Validate resource ownership before operations
- [x] Log all authorization decisions
- [ ] Regularly audit role assignments

### API Security
- [x] Implement API key validation for service-to-service communication
- [x] Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [x] Validate all input parameters
- [x] Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- [ ] Use API gateways for centralized security controls

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest
- [ ] Encrypt database volumes
- [ ] Use encrypted persistent volumes for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement field-level encryption for PII
- [ ] Secure backup storage with encryption
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

### Data in Transit
- [ ] Configure TLS for all services
- [ ] Use strong cipher suites
- [ ] Implement certificate rotation
- [ ] Validate certificates in service-to-service communication
- [ ] Monitor for certificate expiration

### Secrets Management
- [x] Store secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- [x] Use Kubernetes secrets for application access
- [x] Implement secret rotation
- [x] Restrict access to secrets
- [ ] Audit secret access

## Infrastructure Security

### Kubernetes Security
- [x] Use dedicated namespace for production
- [ ] Implement network policies to restrict pod communication
- [ ] Configure pod security policies
- [ ] Use service accounts with minimal permissions
- [ ] Regularly update Kubernetes version
- [ ] Scan container images for vulnerabilities

### Container Security
- [ ] Use minimal base images
- [ ] Run containers as non-root users
- [ ] Implement read-only file systems where possible
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- [ ] Implement resource limits for all containers

### Network Security
- [ ] Configure ingress with proper TLS
- [ ] Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Set up DDoS protection
- [ ] Use private networks for internal communication
- [ ] Implement proper egress controls

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Set up centralized logging
- [ ] Implement log analysis for security events
- [ ] Configure alerts for suspicious activities
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Track API usage patterns

### Incident Response
- [ ] Define security incident response procedures
- [ ] Establish roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Create communication plan
- [ ] Document containment and eradication procedures
- [ ] Implement post-incident analysis

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Logging
- [ ] Log all authentication events
- [ ] Track all administrative actions
- [ ] Monitor data access patterns
- [ ] Implement tamper-proof logging
- [ ] Retain logs according to compliance requirements

### Compliance Controls
- [ ] Document compliance requirements
- [ ] Implement required controls
- [ ] Conduct regular compliance assessments
- [ ] Maintain evidence of compliance
- [ ] Stay updated on regulatory changes

## Security Testing

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] Conduct regular penetration testing
- [ ] Address all identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Verify API security
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

### Vulnerability Management
- [ ] Implement vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Track and prioritize vulnerabilities
- [ ] Establish remediation timelines
- [ ] Verify vulnerability fixes
- [ ] Monitor for new vulnerabilities

## Security Responsibilities

### DevOps Team
- Implement and maintain infrastructure security controls
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Manage secrets and access controls
- Ensure secure CI/CD pipeline
- Respond to security incidents

### Development Team
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement proper input validation
- Use secure authentication and authorization
- Address identified vulnerabilities
- Participate in security code reviews

### Security Team
- Define security policies and standards
- Conduct security assessments
- Monitor for security threats
- Provide security guidance
- Lead incident response
