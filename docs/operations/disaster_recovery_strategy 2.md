# Disaster Recovery and Data Backup Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery and data backup strategy for the EyewearML platform, encompassing all critical systems and data resources.

## 1. Overview

EyewearML's disaster recovery and data backup strategy is designed to ensure business continuity in the face of failures or disasters. The strategy covers all critical components including databases, cloud storage, model data, and configuration files.

### 1.1 Goals

- Minimize data loss (RPO < 1 hour for critical data)
- Ensure rapid recovery (RTO < 4 hours for critical systems)
- Maintain data integrity during backup and restore operations
- Enable point-in-time recovery for all critical databases
- Implement automated backup processes with minimal manual intervention
- Regularly test and validate recovery procedures

### 1.2 Scope

This strategy covers the following systems:
- MongoDB databases
- Firestore data
- Google Cloud Storage
- ML model artifacts
- Application configuration
- Conversation AI assets
- Face analysis models

## 2. Backup Strategy

### 2.1 MongoDB Databases

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Frequency | Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups |
| Tool | `mongodump` / MongoDB Atlas Backup |
| Storage | Local: `./backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` <br> Cloud: GCS bucket: `$PROJECT_ID-backups` |
| Retention | Daily backups: 30 days <br> Weekly backups: 12 weeks <br> Monthly backups: 12 months |
| Encryption | AES-256 for at-rest backups |
| Validation | Automated integrity checks after each backup |

### 2.2 Firestore Data

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Frequency | Daily backups |
| Tool | Firestore export tool |
| Storage | GCS bucket: `$PROJECT_ID-backups/firestore/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` |
| Retention | 30 days rolling |
| Encryption | Google-managed encryption |
| Validation | Post-export metadata verification |

### 2.3 Google Cloud Storage

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Frequency | Daily synchronization |
| Tool | `gsutil rsync` |
| Storage | Secondary GCS bucket with versioning enabled |
| Retention | 90 days versioning history |
| Encryption | Google-managed encryption |
| Validation | Hash verification of critical files |

### 2.4 ML Model Artifacts

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Frequency | After each deployment, daily for active models |
| Tool | Custom scripts using GCS API |
| Storage | GCS bucket: `$PROJECT_ID-backups/models/` |
| Retention | All production model versions retained indefinitely |
| Encryption | Google-managed encryption |
| Validation | Model validation tests after backup |

### 2.5 Application Configuration

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Frequency | After each change, daily snapshots |
| Tool | Git repository backup, Secret Manager export |
| Storage | Secondary Git repository, GCS bucket |
| Retention | All versions retained in Git, 90 days for snapshots |
| Encryption | Repository encryption, GCS encryption |
| Validation | Configuration syntax validation |

## 3. Disaster Recovery Procedures

### 3.1 Database Recovery

#### 3.1.1 MongoDB Recovery

```bash
# MongoDB local recovery
mongorestore --db eyewear_ml --drop ./backups/YYYY-MM-DD/eyewear_ml

# MongoDB Atlas recovery
mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/eyewear_ml" --drop ./backups/YYYY-MM-DD/eyewear_ml
```

#### 3.1.2 Firestore Recovery

```bash
# Firestore import
gcloud firestore import gs://$PROJECT_ID-backups/firestore/YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 3.2 Storage Recovery

```bash
# GCS restoration
gsutil -m cp -r gs://$PROJECT_ID-backups/storage/YYYY-MM-DD/* gs://$PROJECT_ID-assets/
```

### 3.3 ML Model Recovery

```bash
# Model restoration
python scripts/operations/restore_models.py --date YYYY-MM-DD --environment production
```

### 3.4 Application Recovery

```bash
# Config restoration
python scripts/operations/restore_config.py --date YYYY-MM-DD --environment production
```

## 4. Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Backup Testing Schedule

| Component | Testing Frequency | Method |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| MongoDB | Monthly | Restore to test environment |
| Firestore | Quarterly | Restore to test environment |
| GCS | Quarterly | File integrity verification |
| ML Models | Monthly | Model loading and inference tests |
| Configuration | Monthly | Configuration loading tests |

### 4.2 Recovery Drills

Full disaster recovery drills should be conducted quarterly, involving:
- Complete restoration of all systems to a test environment
- Verification of system integrity and functionality
- Measurement of actual recovery time
- Documentation of issues and improvements

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | Implementing and monitoring automated backup processes |
| Data Engineer | Validating database backup integrity |
| ML Engineer | Validating ML model backups |
| Security Engineer | Ensuring encryption and access controls |
| Operations Manager | Overseeing recovery drills and procedure updates |

## 6. Documentation and Reporting

### 6.1 Backup Reports

Automated daily reports should include:
- Backup status for all systems
- Storage utilization
- Validation results
- Errors or warnings

### 6.2 Recovery Documentation

After each recovery drill or actual recovery:
- Document the procedures followed
- Record timing for each step
- Note any deviations from documented procedures
- Identify improvements for future procedures

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Immediate Actions

1. Implement daily MongoDB backup scripts
2. Configure GCS bucket versioning
3. Create backup validation procedures
4. Set up automated backup notifications

### 7.2 Short-term Actions (1-3 months)

1. Develop comprehensive restore testing framework
2. Implement point-in-time recovery for all databases
3. Create training materials for all team members
4. Conduct first full recovery drill

### 7.3 Long-term Actions (3-6 months)

1. Implement multi-region backup strategy
2. Automate failover for critical systems
3. Develop detailed metrics for backup and recovery performance
4. Integrate backup monitoring with overall system monitoring
