# HTML Store Retail Transformation Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the current SKU-Genie admin interface into a professional client-facing eyewear retail store that showcases products from the EyewearML API without any administrative functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
- **Admin Branding**: Uses "SKU-Genie" branding throughout
- **Admin Navigation**: Includes "Import" and "Dashboard" links
- **Admin CTAs**: "Import Products" and "Import More Like This" buttons
- **Admin Messaging**: Promotes "AI-powered product management for eyewear retailers"
- **Mock Data**: Static product cards instead of dynamic API data

### Working Components
- **API Integration**: Correctly configured to fetch from live API endpoint
- **Data Transformation**: Proper product data transformation logic
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based responsive layout
- **Product Display**: Card-based product grid layout

## Target Architecture

### Brand Identity
- **Store Name**: "VisionCraft Eyewear" (professional retail brand)
- **Tagline**: "Discover Your Perfect Frame"
- **Color Scheme**: Modern blue/gray palette for trust and professionalism
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts for e-commerce
