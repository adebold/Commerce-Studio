# Eyewear Recommendation API Implementation

## Overview

This PR implements the core architecture for a FastAPI-based recommendation system for eyewear products. The system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations based on user preferences, browsing history, and purchase data.

## Features

- Complete FastAPI application structure with proper middleware, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Multi-tenant architecture with tenant-specific configurations
- Authentication using API keys
- Layered architecture with separation of concerns:
  - Routes for API endpoints
  - Models for data validation
  - Services for business logic
  - Dependencies for shared functionality

## Implementation Details

### API Structure

The API follows best practices for FastAPI applications:

- **Middleware**: Request logging, timing, CORS, authentication
- **Exception Handling**: Custom handlers for HTTP exceptions, validation errors, and general exceptions
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Enhanced documentation with security schemes
- **Health Check**: Endpoint for monitoring application health

### Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine is designed to provide different types of recommendations:

1. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user preferences, browsing history, and past purchases
2. **Popular Products**: Based on overall popularity metrics
3. **Trending Products**: Based on recent engagement and sales
4. **Similar Products**: Based on product characteristics and attributes

### Multi-Tenant Support

The API is designed to support multiple tenants (e.g., different stores or brands) with:

- Tenant-specific configurations
- Tenant-specific rate limiting
- Tenant-specific data isolation

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Endpoints are designed to be fast and efficient, with proper caching
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling
- **Security**: Authentication, input validation, and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and metrics collection

## Future Enhancements

- **Vector Database Integration**: For embedding-based similarity search
- **A/B Testing Framework**: For testing different recommendation algorithms
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Using product attributes and characteristics
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combining collaborative filtering and content-based approaches

## Testing

The implementation includes a test framework for:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing for performance validation

## Integration with E-commerce Platforms

The API is designed to integrate with:

- Shopify (via the Shopify App)
- BigCommerce (via direct API integration)
- Custom storefronts (via API integration)
