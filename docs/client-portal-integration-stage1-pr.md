# Client Portal Integration - Stage 1

## Overview

This PR implements the first stage of the client portal integration for the VARAi Commerce Studio platform. It includes the core components, API integration, and performance optimizations needed to support the client portal features.

## Changes

### Core Components

1. **Client Portal App**: Main entry point for the client portal integration
2. **Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for viewing metrics and reports
3. **Onboarding Wizard**: Step-by-step guide for new client setup
4. **Report Viewer**: Detailed report viewing with visualizations
5. **Settings Page**: Configuration for account, store, and notifications
6. **Plugin Management**: Installation and management of platform plugins

### API Integration

1. **Client Portal API Client**: Communication with the client portal API
2. **Integration Service**: Business logic for client portal integration
3. **Authentication Utilities**: Secure authentication with the client portal

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Performance Utilities**: Memoization, debouncing, throttling, and caching
2. **Optimized API Client**: Intelligent caching and performance tracking
3. **Optimized React Hook**: Efficient state management and data fetching

### Testing

1. **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all components
2. **API Connection Tests**: Verification of API endpoints
3. **Responsive Design Tests**: Testing across different screen sizes

## User Journeys

This implementation enables the following user journeys:

1. **Client Registration**: Automatic registration when clients install the Shopify app
2. **Onboarding**: Step-by-step guided setup through the wizard
3. **Dashboard Access**: Viewing metrics and reports in the dashboard
4. **Plugin Management**: Installation and configuration of plugins
5. **Settings Management**: Configuration of account and store settings

## Technical Details
