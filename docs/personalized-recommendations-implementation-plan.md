# Personalized Recommendations Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for adding personalized product recommendations to the eyewear platform. The implementation follows a structured approach with modular components to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Components To Implement

1. **Recommendation Service**
   - Create `src/api/services/recommendation_service.py`
   - Implement core recommendation algorithms
   - Integrate with DeepSeek ML service for embeddings
   - Add customer data analysis functionality
   - Include reinforcement learning signal processing

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Enhance `src/api/routers/recommendations.py` with:
     - Personalized recommendations endpoint
     - Reinforcement signal collection endpoint
   
3. **Models**
   - Update `src/api/models/recommendations.py` with:
     - ReinforcementSignal model
     - Enhanced recommendation request/response models

4. **Testing**
   - Create `tests/api/services/test_recommendation_service.py`
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation in `docs/api/personalized-recommendations.md`
   - Create Postman collection in `docs/api/personalized-recommendations-postman.json`
   - Create flow diagrams in `docs/api/personalized-recommendations-flow.md`
   - Outline next steps in `docs/api/personalized-recommendations-next-steps.md`

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Task | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | Implement recommendation service | Week 1 |
| 2 | Create API endpoints | Week 1 |
| 3 | Write unit tests | Week 2 |
| 4 | Create documentation | Week 2 |
| 5 | Code review and refinements | Week 3 |
| 6 | Deployment and A/B testing | Week 3-4 |

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Code Review:** Have a senior engineer review the code for quality, security, and adherence to coding standards.
2. **Testing:** Run the unit tests and integration tests to ensure the system is working as expected.
3. **Deployment:** Deploy the system to a staging environment for further testing.
4. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring to track the performance of the system and identify any issues.
5. **A/B Testing:** Run A/B tests to compare the performance of the personalized recommendation system to the existing system.
6. **Iterate:** Based on the results of the A/B tests, iterate on the system to improve its performance.
7. **Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect any changes made to the system.
8. **Release:** Release the system to production.

## Technical Architecture

```
RecommendationService
├── generate_recommendations() - Main entry point for personalized recommendations
├── fetch_customer_data() - Retrieves customer data from DB
├── fetch_product_data() - Gets product catalog data
├── generate_product_embeddings() - Creates ML embeddings for products
├── generate_user_embedding() - Creates ML embedding for user preferences
├── calculate_similarity_scores() - Ranks products by relevance to user
├── filter_recommendations_by_measurements() - Applies frame size filters
├── filter_recommendations_by_prescription() - Applies prescription filters
└── record_reinforcement_signal() - Records user interaction signals
```

## Data Flow

1. Client requests personalized recommendations
2. API retrieves customer data (preferences, history, measurements)
3. System fetches relevant product data
4. ML service generates embeddings for products and user preferences
5. Similarity scoring ranks products by relevance
6. Additional filters applied based on measurements and prescription
7. Final ranked recommendations returned to client
8. User interactions recorded via reinforcement signals API

This implementation will provide highly tailored product recommendations that improve over time through reinforcement learning signals collected from user interactions.
