# Authentication Feature - Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for the **Authentication** feature within the **Management Portal**. This feature will secure the application and ensure that only authorized users can access administrative pages by integrating with the existing **Auth Service**.

## 2. User Stories

-   As an administrator, I want to be able to log in to the Management Portal using my existing Commerce Studio credentials so that I can access the administrative dashboard.
-   As an administrator, I want to be able to log out of the Management Portal so that I can securely end my session.
-   As a user, I want to be redirected to the login page if I try to access a protected page without being authenticated.

## 3. UI/UX Design

The Authentication feature will consist of a single main page:

-   **Login Page**: A simple form with fields for email and password, and a "Login" button.

## 4. Component Breakdown

### 4.1. `LoginPage.jsx`

-   **`LoginForm`**: A form component with fields for email and password, and a "Login" button.

## 5. State Management (Redux)

The existing `authSlice` will be used to manage the state for the Authentication feature.

-   **`isAuthenticated`**: A boolean indicating whether the user is authenticated.
-   **`user`**: The user object for the authenticated user.
-   **`token`**: The JWT for the authenticated user.
-   **`status`**: The current status of API requests (`idle`, `loading`, `succeeded`, `failed`).
-   **`error`**: Any error messages from API requests.

## 6. API Integration

The components will interact with the existing **Auth Service** (`auth-service`) via a dedicated API client.

**`auth-api.js`**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL, // This should point to the existing auth-service
});

export const login = (credentials) => apiClient.post('/auth/login', credentials);
export const logout = () => apiClient.post('/auth/logout');
export const getUserProfile = () => apiClient.get('/auth/profile');
```

## 7. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create `auth-api.js`**: Build the API client for interacting with the Auth Service.
2.  **Develop `LoginForm`**: Build the form component for handling user login.
3.  **Implement `LoginPage`**: Create the page that displays the `LoginForm`.
4.  **Update `authSlice`**: Add async thunks for handling login, logout, and fetching the user profile.
5.  **Integrate with `PrivateRoute`**: Ensure that the `PrivateRoute` component correctly uses the `authSlice` to protect routes.

This plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Authentication feature by integrating with the existing Auth Service, ensuring a consistent and secure authentication experience across the platform.
