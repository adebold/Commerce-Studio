# Analytics Dashboard Feature - Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for the **Analytics Dashboard** feature within the **Management Portal**. This feature will provide administrators with a user-friendly interface for viewing key performance metrics for each tenant's storefront, offering valuable insights into sales, conversions, and customer engagement.

## 2. User Stories

-   As an administrator, I want to see an overview of key metrics for all tenants so that I can quickly assess the health of the platform.
-   As an administrator, I want to be able to drill down into the analytics for a specific tenant so that I can understand their performance in detail.
-   As an administrator, I want to be able to filter analytics data by date range so that I can analyze trends over time.

## 3. UI/UX Design

The Analytics Dashboard will consist of a single page with the following components:

-   **Global Metrics**: A set of cards displaying platform-wide metrics (e.g., total revenue, total orders, new tenants).
-   **Tenant-Specific Metrics**: A table or set of charts displaying key metrics for each tenant (e.g., revenue, orders, conversion rate).
-   **Date Range Filter**: A date picker for filtering the analytics data.

## 4. Component Breakdown

### 4.1. `AnalyticsPage.jsx`

-   **`MetricCard`**: A reusable component for displaying a single key metric.
-   **`AnalyticsChart`**: A reusable chart component for visualizing data (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts).
-   **`DateRangePicker`**: A component for selecting a date range.

## 5. State Management (Redux)

A new `analyticsSlice` will be created to manage the state for the Analytics Dashboard feature.

-   **`globalMetrics`**: An object containing platform-wide metrics.
-   **`tenantMetrics`**: An array of objects, with each object containing the metrics for a specific tenant.
-   **`status`**: The current status of API requests (`idle`, `loading`, `succeeded`, `failed`).
-   **`error`**: Any error messages from API requests.

## 6. API Integration

The components will interact with a new **Analytics Service** via a dedicated API client.

**`analytics-api.js`**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_API_URL,
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}` }
});

export const getGlobalMetrics = (dateRange) => apiClient.get('/metrics/global', { params: { dateRange } });
export const getTenantMetrics = (dateRange) => apiClient.get('/metrics/tenants', { params: { dateRange } });
```

## 7. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create `analyticsSlice`**: Implement the Redux slice for managing analytics state.
2.  **Build `analytics-api.js`**: Create the API client for interacting with the Analytics Service.
3.  **Develop `MetricCard`**: Build the reusable component for displaying a single key metric.
4.  **Implement `AnalyticsChart`**: Create the reusable chart component for visualizing data.
5.  **Develop `DateRangePicker`**: Build the component for selecting a date range.
6.  **Integrate into `AnalyticsPage`**: Add the new components to the `AnalyticsPage` and connect them to the Redux store and API client.

This plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Analytics Dashboard feature, which will provide valuable insights into the performance of the Commerce Studio platform and its tenants.
