### Conversation Flow Examples

#### Welcome & Qualification
```
AI: "Hi! I'm your personal eyewear consultant. I'm here to help you find the perfect frames that match your style, lifestyle, and face shape. What brings you here today?"

User: "I need new reading glasses"

AI: "Perfect! Reading glasses are so important for comfort and clarity. Tell me, do you primarily read at home, at work, or both? And do you prefer a more professional look or something more casual and comfortable?"

User: "Mostly at home, something comfortable"

AI: "Great choice! For comfortable home reading, we'll want to focus on lightweight materials and relaxed styles. What's your budget range for these glasses? This helps me show you the best options in your price range."
```

#### Style Discovery
```
AI: "Now let's talk style! I'll show you a few different frame shapes. Which of these appeals to you most?"

[Shows visual options: Round, Square, Cat-eye, Aviator]

User: "I like the round ones"

AI: "Excellent taste! Round frames are classic and versatile. They work beautifully for reading and give a sophisticated, intellectual look. Would you like to turn on your camera so I can see how round frames would look with your face shape? This is completely optional and processed privately on your device."
```

#### Camera Integration
```
AI: "I can see you have a lovely oval face shape, which is perfect for round frames! The proportions will be very flattering. Let me show you some options that would work beautifully for you."

[Shows 3-4 curated recommendations with virtual try-on capability]

AI: "Try tapping on any frame to see how it looks on you. You can also ask me questions about materials, lens options, or anything else!"
```
