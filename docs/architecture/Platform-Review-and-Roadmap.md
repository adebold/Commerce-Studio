- **Intuitive Onboarding**: Streamline the signup and onboarding process with guided tours and interactive demos

## Database Interaction Guidelines

When integrating with client systems, SKU-Genie follows these important principles:

1. **Master Database**: SKU-Genie maintains its own master database of product information.

2. **EAN Code as Primary Key**: The EAN (European Article Number) code is used as the primary key for identifying products across systems.

3. **Read and Update Operations**: SKU-Genie can read and update client files/records, but cannot delete files from client databases.

4. **Product Status Preservation**: Products in client systems may have different statuses (live, published, closed, unpublished). SKU-Genie never changes the status of a product on the client system.

5. **Data Synchronization**: When updating product information, SKU-Genie ensures that the client's product status remains unchanged while enhancing the product data.

## Proposed Home Page Design

The new home page should follow Apple's design principles of simplicity, elegance, and clarity:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Bold headline: "The Future of Eyewear Retail"
   - Subheading: "AI-powered solutions for seamless omnichannel experiences"
   - Background: Subtle animation showing the platform's capabilities
   - CTA: "Get Started" button prominently displayed

2. **Key Features Section**
   - Clean, icon-based representation of core features
   - Minimal text with maximum impact
   - Subtle animations that trigger on scroll

3. **Integration Showcase**
   - Visual representation of how SKU-Genie connects physical and online stores
   - Logos of supported platforms and systems
   - Success metrics from current clients

4. **App Marketplace Preview**
   - Carousel of available apps with brief descriptions
   - Visual examples of each app in action
   - "Explore Apps" CTA

5. **Testimonials**
   - Quotes from satisfied retailers
   - Before/after metrics showing impact
   - Industry recognition and awards

6. **Pricing & Plans**
   - Transparent, simple pricing structure
   - Feature comparison across plans
   - Custom enterprise solutions option

7. **Sign-up Section**
   - Streamlined form with minimal required fields
   - Option to schedule a demo
   - Immediate access to a limited trial
