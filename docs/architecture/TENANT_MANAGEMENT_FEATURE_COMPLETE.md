# Tenant Management Feature - Implementation Complete

## 1. Executive Summary

I have successfully implemented the **Tenant Management** feature within the **Management Portal**. This feature provides administrators with a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, updating, and deactivating tenant accounts, and is a critical first step in building out the full functionality of the portal.

## 2. What Has Been Built

### 2.1. Redux State Management
- A `tenantsSlice` has been created to manage all tenant-related state, including fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tenants.

### 2.2. API Integration
- A dedicated API client (`tenant-api.js`) has been built to communicate with the **Tenant Management Service**.

### 2.3. Reusable Components
- **`TenantTable`**: A reusable table component for displaying a list of tenants.
- **`TenantForm`**: A reusable form for creating and editing tenant information.
- **`CreateTenantDialog`**: A dialog for creating new tenants.

### 2.4. Feature-Complete UI
- **`TenantListPage`**: A page that displays all tenants and allows for the creation and deactivation of tenants.
- **`TenantDetailPage`**: A page that displays the details of a specific tenant and allows for editing.

## 3. Business Value

- **Efficient Tenant Management**: Administrators can now easily manage all tenant accounts from a single, centralized interface.
- **Improved Onboarding**: The process of creating a new tenant is now streamlined and user-friendly.
- **Foundation for Growth**: This feature provides the foundation for managing a large number of tenants as the platform scales.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Implement Store Provisioning UI**: Build the interface for triggering and monitoring store provisioning jobs.
2.  **Develop Analytics Dashboard**: Create the charts and data visualizations for the analytics page.
3.  **Implement Authentication**: Build out the login page and connect it to the backend authentication service.
4.  **End-to-End Testing**: Thoroughly test the entire Tenant Management workflow, from the UI to the backend service.

This implementation of the Tenant Management feature is a significant milestone in the development of the Management Portal, and provides a solid foundation for the remaining features.
