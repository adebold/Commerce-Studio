   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Token management and validation
   - User profile management

3. **Service Infrastructure Implementation**
   - Service registry and discovery using Consul
   - Message broker using RabbitMQ
   - Service template for standardized implementation
   - Resilience patterns for fault tolerance

4. **Data Management Layer Implementation**
   - Database abstraction with MongoDB
   - Caching strategy with Redis
   - Migration framework for schema versioning
   - Data models for core business entities

5. **Observability Stack Implementation**
   - Centralized logging with EFK stack
   - Metrics collection with Prometheus and Grafana
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Alerting system with Alertmanager

6. **Business Services Implementation**
   - Product service for catalog management
   - User service for profile management
   - Order service for order processing
   - Inventory service for stock management
   - Search service for product discovery

7. **Frontend Integration Implementation**
   - React application with TypeScript
   - Redux state management
   - Material UI component library
   - Storybook for component development
   - Responsive design and accessibility

## Technical Details

### API Gateway

- Kong API Gateway with declarative configuration

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for metrics visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Alertmanager for notifications

### Business Services

- Microservices architecture with domain-driven design
- Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- CQRS pattern for separation of concerns
- Repository pattern for data access

### Frontend Integration

- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Redux for state management
- Material UI for component library
- Storybook for component development
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1

## Shopify App Integration

The VARAi Commerce Studio includes a Shopify app integration that allows merchants to seamlessly connect their Shopify stores with the platform. The Shopify app provides the following features:

- Product synchronization: Automatically sync products from Shopify to the VARAi Commerce Studio platform.
- Order management: View and manage Shopify orders within the VARAi Commerce Studio.
- Customer insights: Gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

The Shopify app is built using Node.js and integrates with the VARAi Commerce Studio API.

### Improvements

This pull request includes the following improvements to the Shopify app:

- Replaced the default MemoryStore with MongoDB for session storage to prevent memory leaks and improve production readiness.
- Added instructions to suppress the punycode deprecation warning using the NODE_OPTIONS flag.
