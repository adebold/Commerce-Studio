## 🚨 Incident Response and Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers

#### Critical Failure Conditions
1. **Memory Leak Detection**: >20MB growth in 1 hour
2. **Performance Degradation**: P95 >300ms for 5 minutes
3. **High Error Rate**: >5% errors for 2 minutes
4. **Security Breach**: Any critical vulnerability detected

#### Rollback Execution
```bash
# Automated rollback script
./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh

# Manual rollback validation
npm run validate:rollback:success

# Health check post-rollback
npm run health:check:post-rollback
```

### Incident Response Workflow

#### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-5 minutes)
1. **Automated Detection**: Monitoring systems trigger alerts
2. **Initial Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Team Notification**: Alert relevant team members
4. **Decision Point**: Continue monitoring vs. initiate rollback

#### Phase 2: Response and Mitigation (5-15 minutes)
1. **Rollback Decision**: If critical thresholds exceeded
2. **Rollback Execution**: Automated rollback procedures
3. **Validation**: Confirm rollback success
4. **Communication**: Update stakeholders

#### Phase 3: Investigation and Resolution (15+ minutes)
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate failure cause
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test fix
3. **Re-deployment**: Deploy fix with validation
4. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned
