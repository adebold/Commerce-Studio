# Terraform Init Blockage Report

## Overview

This document reports on a persistent error encountered during `terraform init` operations. The issue prevents proper initialization of Terraform configurations and blocks deployment workflows. This report documents the error, investigation steps taken, and findings to assist in resolution.

## Error Description

When running `terraform init`, the following error is consistently encountered:

```
Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider hashicorp/mongodbatlas
```

This error prevents Terraform from initializing properly and blocks any subsequent Terraform operations.

## Investigation Steps

The following steps were taken to investigate and diagnose the issue:

1. Examined the provider configuration in `terraform/modules/database/main.tf`
2. Verified the correct provider source specification
3. Performed a comprehensive search across all `.tf` files in the `terraform/` directory for any instances of "hashicorp/mongodbatlas"
4. Analyzed potential provider resolution issues

## Findings

The investigation revealed the following key findings:

1. The configuration in `terraform/modules/database/main.tf` correctly specifies the provider source as `mongodb/mongodbatlas`, which is the official provider.

2. A search across all `.tf` files in the `terraform/` directory for "hashicorp/mongodbatlas" returned 0 results, confirming that no file explicitly references this incorrect provider path.

3. The files examined during this investigation were:
   - `terraform/main.tf`
   - `terraform/modules/database/main.tf`

4. Despite the correct provider specification in the configuration files, Terraform is attempting to resolve the provider from an incorrect source path (`hashicorp/mongodbatlas` instead of `mongodb/mongodbatlas`).

## Potential Causes

Based on the findings, the following are potential causes of the issue:

1. Terraform may be using cached or previously resolved provider information
2. There might be an implicit provider inheritance issue in the module structure
3. The Terraform version being used might have a known issue with provider resolution
4. Local Terraform configuration might be overriding the provider source

## Recommended Next Steps

To resolve this issue, consider the following actions:

1. Clear the Terraform cache and provider plugins directory
2. Explicitly define the provider in the root module with the correct source
3. Verify Terraform version compatibility with the MongoDB Atlas provider
4. Check for any `.terraformrc` or environment variables that might affect provider resolution
5. Try running with verbose logging enabled to get more detailed information about the provider resolution process

## Conclusion

The Terraform initialization blockage is caused by an incorrect provider source resolution, despite the correct configuration in the relevant files. The recommended next steps should help identify and resolve the underlying issue.
