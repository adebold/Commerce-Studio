# Frontend Enhancements: Router Fix and UI Improvements

## Problems Addressed

1. **Router Configuration Issue**: The frontend deployment was failing due to a React Router configuration issue. Specifically, the error was:
   ```
   Uncaught Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
   ```
   This occurred because the `AuthProvider` component uses the `useNavigate` hook but was incorrectly placed outside the `Router` component in `routes.tsx`.

2. **Navigation Design**: The navigation experience was inconsistent between logged-in and logged-out states and lacked a modern, professional appearance.

3. **Homepage Imagery**: The homepage needed better imagery and an Apple-inspired design to create a more premium brand experience.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Router Configuration Fix

Modified the component nesting order in `routes.tsx` to properly place the `AuthProvider` inside the `Router` component:

```tsx
// Before (incorrect)
<AuthProvider>
  <Router>
    {/* Router content */}
  </Router>
</AuthProvider>

// After (fixed)
<Router>
  <AuthProvider>
    {/* Router content */}
  </AuthProvider>
</Router>
```

### 2. Navigation Enhancement

Redesigned the navigation with Apple-inspired styling:
- Added a sleek, translucent navigation bar with blur effect
- Created consistent navigation items across all user states
- Improved the visual hierarchy with better typography and spacing
- Enhanced the login/logout buttons with modern pill-shaped styling
- Added role-specific dashboard links that maintain consistent UI
- Applied proper hover effects for improved user interaction

### 3. Homepage Improvements

Enhanced the homepage with modern, feature-focused sections:
- Added high-quality image placeholders for product features
- Created dedicated sections for key capabilities like Face Shape Analysis and Virtual Try-On
- Applied Apple-inspired typography, spacing, and color schemes
- Improved responsive layout for better mobile experience
- Enhanced CTAs (Call to Action buttons) with consistent styling

## Testing

- Successfully built and deployed the frontend to Google Cloud Run
- Verified the application loads correctly without router errors
- Confirmed the navigation displays properly across different screen sizes
- Tested UI in both authenticated and non-authenticated states
- Frontend service is now accessible at: https://eyewear-ml-frontend-ddtojwjn7a-uc.a.run.app

## Additional Notes

These enhancements significantly improve both the functionality and appearance of the frontend application. The Apple-inspired design creates a more premium feel that better aligns with our brand positioning in the eyewear market.
