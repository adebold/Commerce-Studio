# Advanced Recommendation Engine and A/B Testing Framework

## Overview

This PR adds two major enhancements to the SKU-Genie platform:

1. A sophisticated product recommendation engine that leverages face shape compatibility, style preferences, browsing history, and other factors to provide personalized product recommendations.

2. A comprehensive A/B testing framework to measure the impact of enhanced product data on conversion rates and other key metrics.

These features build upon the enhanced store integration and provide powerful tools for optimizing the customer experience and measuring the business impact of SKU-Genie's enhanced product data.

## Features

### 1. Sophisticated Product Recommendation Engine

- **Multi-factor Recommendation Algorithm**: Combines multiple signals to generate personalized recommendations:
  - Face shape compatibility scores
  - Style preferences derived from browsing behavior
  - Purchase history analysis
  - Collaborative filtering based on similar users
  - Content-based filtering using product attributes

- **User Preference Tracking**: Automatically builds a profile of user preferences based on browsing and purchase behavior.

- **Configurable Weighting System**: Allows adjustment of the importance of different factors in the recommendation algorithm.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Optional integration with external ML models for advanced recommendation capabilities.

- **Recommendation Display**: Adds a "Recommended For You" section to the store interface with visually distinct product cards.

### 2. A/B Testing Framework

- **Variant Testing**: Supports testing different versions of features to measure their impact:
  - Face shape compatibility display
  - Product recommendations
  - Virtual try-on functionality

- **Comprehensive Metrics Tracking**:
  - Product views
  - Add to cart actions
  - Checkout starts
  - Completed purchases
  - Time on page
  - Recommendation clicks

- **User Assignment**: Automatically assigns users to test variants with configurable weighting.

- **Analytics Integration**: Sends event data to an analytics endpoint for detailed analysis.

- **Local Storage**: Maintains consistent user experience across sessions using local storage.

## Implementation Details

### Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine (`recommendation-engine.js`) provides:

- A user data store that tracks face shape, style preferences, browsing history, and purchase history
- A weighted scoring system for ranking products based on multiple factors
- Methods for tracking user interactions with products
- A fallback to simpler recommendations when data is limited

### A/B Testing Framework

The A/B testing framework (`ab-testing.js`) provides:

- Test configuration with variants, weights, and active test periods
- User assignment to test variants
- Event tracking for measuring test outcomes
- Integration with analytics systems
- Methods for conditionally enabling features based on test assignment

## Integration with Existing Code

- The recommendation engine is integrated with the product display to show personalized recommendations
- The A/B testing framework conditionally enables enhanced features based on test assignment
- Event tracking is added to key user interactions (product views, add to cart, etc.)
- The UI is updated to display recommendations prominently

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Various user profiles and browsing patterns
- Different face shapes and style preferences
- A range of product attributes and compatibility scores
- Multiple test variants and configurations

## Future Improvements

While this PR implements significant enhancements, there are opportunities for further improvements:

1. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Integrate more sophisticated ML models for recommendation generation
2. **Real-time Analytics Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for monitoring A/B test results in real-time
3. **Personalization API**: Expose the recommendation engine as an API for use in other applications
4. **Multi-variate Testing**: Extend the A/B testing framework to support multi-variate testing
5. **User Segmentation**: Add support for targeting tests to specific user segments

## Documentation

Documentation is provided in code comments and the updated README file, covering:
- Configuration options for both systems
- Integration guidelines for developers
- Event tracking specifications
- Test setup and analysis recommendations
