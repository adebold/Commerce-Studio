# Disaster Recovery System Implementation

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive disaster recovery and backup system for the EyewearML platform. It adds automated scripts for MongoDB, Firestore, and GCS backup/recovery operations, along with detailed documentation for the operations team.

## Changes Made
- Added backup and restore scripts for MongoDB
- Added backup and restore scripts for Firestore
- Added backup and restore scripts for Google Cloud Storage
- Created developer documentation with setup instructions
- Added a disaster recovery strategy document
- Added agentic prompts for future extensions

## Testing Performed
- Manual testing of backup and restore scripts in isolated environments
- Validated integrity check procedures
- Tested encryption and decryption operations
- Verified point-in-time restore capabilities 

## Implementation Notes
All scripts follow consistent patterns:
- Configuration via environment variables or config files
- Detailed logging with timestamps
- Email/webhook notifications
- Test mode for safe validation
- Integrity verification

## Deployment Notes
These scripts should be deployed to production backup servers and configured with appropriate credentials. Scheduling should be set up through cron jobs following the recommended schedule in the documentation.

## Security Considerations
- Encryption keys should be stored securely, separate from backups
- Access to restore scripts should be limited to privileged users
- Monitoring should be configured for backup job success/failure
