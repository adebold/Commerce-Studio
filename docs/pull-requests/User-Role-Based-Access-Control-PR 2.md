# User Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation PR

## Overview

This PR implements comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms for the VARAi Commerce Studio application. It ensures that users can only access pages and UI elements appropriate for their role. The implementation includes:

1. Enhanced router with protected routes and role-based access controls
2. Redesigned navigation with appropriate menu visibility based on user roles
3. Improved error handling for unauthorized access attempts
4. Extensive E2E test coverage for access control

## Changes

### Frontend Router Enhancements

- Implemented a `ProtectedRoute` component that checks user authentication and role permissions
- Added proper route guards for all protected pages based on role hierarchy
- Added proper error feedback for unauthorized access attempts
- Added a 404 page for non-existent routes
- Fixed the App Store page route

### New E2E Tests

Three new E2E test modules were added:

1. **test_user_page_access.py**: Tests which pages each role can access and which are restricted
2. **test_dashboard_access.py**: Specifically tests dashboard access based on role hierarchy  
3. **test_ui_element_visibility.py**: Tests that UI elements (buttons, menus, forms) are properly shown/hidden based on user roles

These tests verify that:
- Anonymous users can only access public pages
- Each role can access only authorized pages
- Users are redirected to appropriate dashboards after login
- Unauthorized access attempts show appropriate error messages
- UI elements are displayed or hidden according to permission levels

### Role Hierarchy

The implementation follows this role hierarchy for access control:

1. **Super Admin**: Has access to all pages and features
2. **Client Admin**: Has access to client management features and subordinate dashboards
3. **Brand Manager**: Limited to brand management features
4. **Viewer**: Basic access to view data and recommendations

### Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages React Router's capabilities combined with the AuthProvider context to create a clean, maintainable authorization system. Key technical aspects:

- Use of React context for role-based checks
- Non-intrusive integration with the existing routing system
- Clear separation of concerns between routing, authorization, and components
- No duplication of authorization logic

## Testing

All changes are covered by E2E tests that verify proper access control from the user's perspective. The tests simulate different user roles and verify access to pages and UI elements. Tests cover both:

- Positive testing (users can access what they should)
- Negative testing (users cannot access what they shouldn't)

## Further Work

Future enhancements to consider:
- Fine-grained permission system beyond just roles
- Audit logging of access attempts
- Enhanced error feedback with more context-specific messages
