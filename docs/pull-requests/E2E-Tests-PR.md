# End-to-End Testing Framework for SKU-Genie

## Overview

This PR adds a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the SKU-Genie platform, ensuring the reliability and quality of our enhanced store integration, recommendation engine, A/B testing framework, and analytics dashboard. The tests are implemented using Cypress, a modern JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that provides a robust and developer-friendly testing experience.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Test Coverage

- **Store Functionality Tests**: Verify product display, filtering, product details, and face shape compatibility features
- **Recommendation Engine Tests**: Validate personalized recommendations, recommendation tracking, and algorithm performance
- **A/B Testing Framework Tests**: Ensure proper test variant assignment, event tracking, and consistent user experience
- **Virtual Try-On Tests**: Confirm face shape visualization, product navigation, and compatibility information
- **Dashboard Tests**: Verify metrics display, chart rendering, and tab navigation

### 2. Test Infrastructure

- **Cypress Configuration**: Optimized Cypress setup with appropriate timeouts, viewport settings, and plugin configuration
- **Custom Commands**: Extensive library of custom commands to simplify test writing and maintenance
- **Fixtures**: Mock data for products, recommendations, and A/B testing results
- **CI/CD Integration**: Scripts for running tests in continuous integration environments

### 3. Mock API Integration

- **API Mocking**: Intercept and mock API requests to test both success and error scenarios
- **Fallback Handling**: Verify graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **Response Validation**: Ensure proper handling of API responses

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure

The tests are organized into logical suites:

- `store.spec.js` - Tests for the basic store functionality
- `recommendations.spec.js` - Tests for the recommendation engine
- `ab-testing.spec.js` - Tests for the A/B testing framework
- `virtual-try-on.spec.js` - Tests for the virtual try-on feature
- `dashboard.spec.js` - Tests for the analytics dashboard

### Custom Commands

A rich set of custom commands has been implemented to simplify test writing:

- Navigation commands (visitStore, visitDashboard)
- Interaction commands (openProductDetails, filterByFaceShape)
- Assertion commands (shouldHaveProductCount, shouldRenderChart)
- Mock data commands (mockProducts, mockABTestData)

### Fixtures

Fixture data has been created to support testing:

- `products.json` - Sample product data
- `recommendations.json` - Sample recommendation data
- `ab-testing.json` - Sample A/B testing data

## Running the Tests

The tests can be run using npm scripts:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Open Cypress Test Runner
npm run test:open

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:store
npm run test:recommendations
npm run test:ab-testing
npm run test:virtual-try-on
npm run test:dashboard

# Run tests with server
npm run test:ci
```

## Benefits

### 1. Quality Assurance

- **Regression Prevention**: Catch regressions before they reach production
- **Feature Verification**: Ensure new features work as expected
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Tests run in multiple browsers to ensure consistent experience

### 2. Development Efficiency

- **Faster Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on code changes
- **Simplified Debugging**: Cypress provides clear error messages and visual debugging tools
- **Reduced Manual Testing**: Automate repetitive testing tasks

### 3. Documentation

- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for how features should work
- **Onboarding Aid**: New developers can understand system behavior by reviewing tests
- **Behavior Specification**: Tests clearly define expected behavior

## Future Improvements

While this PR implements a comprehensive testing framework, there are opportunities for further enhancements:

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add visual regression tests to catch UI changes
2. **Performance Testing**: Implement performance benchmarks for critical user flows
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Add tests for accessibility compliance
4. **Mobile Testing**: Expand tests to cover mobile-specific interactions
5. **Test Data Generation**: Create more diverse test data sets for edge cases

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided in the `cypress/README.md` file, covering:
- Test structure and organization
- Running tests locally and in CI
- Adding new tests
- Troubleshooting common issues
