# Phase 3: Domain Expertise Integration & Face Analysis

This PR completes Phase 3 of the Vertex AI Integration project by implementing domain expertise components and adding face analysis capabilities through MediaPipe integration.

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on injecting eyewear domain expertise into the Vertex AI conversational system. The implementation creates a bidirectional enhancement approach:

1. **Enhanced Prompts**: Specialized prompts enriched with domain knowledge before sending to Vertex AI
2. **Enhanced Responses**: Post-processing of responses to add domain-specific details and recommendations

The PR also lays groundwork for Phase 4 by creating a face analysis integration that enables multi-modal interactions.

## Changes

### Domain Expertise Components
- **Fixed variable naming conflicts** in `response-augmentor.ts` to resolve TypeScript errors
- **Created comprehensive knowledge base** for eyewear expertise
- **Implemented response augmentation** to enrich AI responses with domain knowledge
- **Added prompt engineering service** to create specialized eyewear-focused prompts

### Face Analysis Integration
- **Developed face analysis connector** (`face-analysis-connector.ts`) to integrate MediaPipe face shape detection
- **Created test suite** (`face-analysis-connector.test.ts`) with unit tests and integration examples
- **Built interactive demo** (`face-analysis-demo.html`) for real-time face shape analysis using webcam
- **Designed integration architecture** to connect visual analysis with domain knowledge

### Documentation
- **Created Phase 3 summary document** (`phase3_domain_expertise_summary.md`) with implementation details
- **Updated implementation guide** to mark Phase 3 as complete
- **Developed Phase 4 enhancement plan** with detailed approach for future improvements

## Technical Details

### Domain Knowledge Base
- Structured data repository for face shape compatibility matrix, style information database, and material properties
- Queryable interface to access specialized eyewear knowledge programmatically
- Modular design for easy expansion with new knowledge categories

### Response Augmentation
- Analyzes responses for enhancement opportunities in 6 different areas
- Adds domain-specific details while maintaining natural language flow
- Preserves original response semantics while enhancing with specialized knowledge

### Face Analysis
- Real-time face detection and landmark mapping using MediaPipe
- Precise measurements for face dimensions and proportions
- Confidence-scored face shape classification
- Frame recommendations based on face geometry
- Bidirectional connection with domain knowledge base

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for face analysis connector
- Integration tests showing usage patterns
- Interactive demo for face analysis verification
- Type definitions to ensure type safety

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, we're ready to move to Phase 4 (Testing & Optimization), including:
1. Implementing the enhancement strategies outlined in the Phase 4 plan
2. Full integration of MediaPipe face analysis into the conversation flows
3. Performance optimization of the domain knowledge integration
4. Comprehensive end-to-end testing of the enhanced system
