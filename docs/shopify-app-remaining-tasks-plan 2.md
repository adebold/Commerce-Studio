# Plan: Implement Remaining Shopify App Tasks

**Goal:** Complete the Shopify app integration by implementing the remaining features: real-time dashboard UI, enhanced notification system, performance optimizations, and order management integration.

**1. Create Real-Time Dashboard UI (Estimated Time: 8 hours)**

*   Design the UI for the dashboard, including key metrics and visualizations.
*   Implement the UI using React and Material UI.
*   Integrate with the existing analytics API to display sync status, performance metrics, and error trends.
*   Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates on sync progress and any issues.

**2. Implement Enhanced Notification System (Estimated Time: 6 hours)**

*   Identify critical conflict scenarios that require immediate attention.
*   Implement a notification system that alerts administrators via email and in-app notifications for these critical conflicts.
*   Allow administrators to configure notification preferences (e.g., email frequency, notification types).
*   Integrate with the existing notification service to send notifications.

**3. Optimize Performance for Large Catalogs (Estimated Time: 8 hours)**

*   Profile the synchronization process to identify performance bottlenecks.
*   Implement optimizations such as:
    *   Caching frequently accessed data
    *   Using asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread
    *   Optimizing database queries
    *   Implementing pagination for large data sets
*   Test the performance of the integration with very large catalogs (10,000+ products).

**4. Integrate with Order Management Systems (Estimated Time: 10 hours)**

*   Research and select an appropriate order management system (OMS) to integrate with.
*   Implement API integration with the selected OMS to retrieve order data.
*   Map Shopify order data to the OMS data model.
*   Implement synchronization of order data between Shopify and the OMS.
*   Implement webhooks to receive real-time updates from Shopify on order changes.

**5. Testing (Estimated Time: 8 hours)**

*   Write unit tests for the new components and services.
*   Write integration tests to verify that the integration with the OMS is working correctly.
*   Manually test the new features to ensure that they are working as expected.
*   Perform load testing to ensure that the system can handle a large volume of orders.

**6. Deployment (Estimated Time: 2 hours)**

*   Deploy the changes to the production environment.
*   Monitor the system to ensure that the new features are working correctly and that there are no unexpected issues.

**Total Estimated Time: 42 hours**
