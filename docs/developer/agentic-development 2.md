- **Mode-Based Specialization**: Using specialized AI modes for different development tasks
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective instructions to guide AI behavior
- **Iterative Collaboration**: Working with AI in an iterative, feedback-driven process
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces for AI assistance

### Benefits of Agentic Development

- **Increased Productivity**: Accelerate development by delegating appropriate tasks to AI
- **Specialized Expertise**: Access specialized capabilities through different AI modes
- **Consistent Quality**: Maintain consistent code quality and documentation standards
- **Knowledge Amplification**: Leverage AI's broad knowledge base for problem-solving
- **Focus on High-Value Work**: Spend more time on creative and strategic aspects of development
