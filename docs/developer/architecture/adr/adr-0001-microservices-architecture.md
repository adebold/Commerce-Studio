# ADR-0001: Adopt Microservices Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The VARAi platform needs to support multiple e-commerce integrations, handle complex ML workloads, and scale independently based on demand. The platform also needs to be maintainable by multiple development teams working in parallel.

Key considerations:
- The platform will have components with different scaling needs (e.g., ML processing vs. API endpoints)
- Different components may have different technology requirements
- We need to enable multiple teams to work independently
- The system needs to be resilient to failures in individual components
- We need to support rapid iteration and deployment of individual components

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture for the VARAi platform, with the following key components:

1. **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests
2. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
3. **ML Service**: Manages machine learning models and processing
4. **Recommendation Service**: Generates product recommendations
5. **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes usage data
6. **Integration Service**: Manages connections to e-commerce platforms
7. **Admin Service**: Provides merchant configuration capabilities
8. **Storage Service**: Manages file storage and retrieval

Each service will:
- Be independently deployable
- Have its own codebase and repository
- Own its data storage
- Communicate via well-defined APIs
- Be containerized for deployment
- Have its own CI/CD pipeline

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Independent Scaling**: Services can scale based on their specific demands
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Isolation**: Failures in one service don't necessarily affect others
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand and maintain

### Negative

- **Increased Operational Complexity**: More services to deploy, monitor, and maintain
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Need to handle network latency, consistency, and failure scenarios
- **Service Discovery**: Need mechanisms for services to find and communicate with each other
- **Monitoring Complexity**: Need comprehensive monitoring across services
- **Testing Complexity**: End-to-end testing becomes more challenging

### Neutral

- **API Design Focus**: Teams need to carefully design service APIs
- **DevOps Requirements**: Need strong DevOps practices and tooling
- **Documentation Importance**: Clear documentation becomes even more critical

## Compliance

All new features and components must be designed as microservices following these guidelines:

1. Services must be independently deployable
2. Services must communicate via well-defined APIs (REST or gRPC)
3. Services should own their data and not directly access other services' databases
4. Services should be designed around business capabilities, not technical layers
5. Services should implement appropriate resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, etc.)

### Implementation Details

- We will use Kubernetes for orchestration
- Service-to-service communication will primarily use REST APIs
- For high-throughput or performance-critical paths, we may use gRPC
- Asynchronous communication will use RabbitMQ
- Service discovery will be handled by Kubernetes
