5. **Data Processors**: Create custom data processing pipelines
6. **Analytics Extensions**: Add custom analytics and reporting capabilities

## Getting Started

To get started with extension development, you should:

1. Set up your [development environment](../environment/local-development-guide.md)
2. Understand the [architecture](../architecture/index.md) of the VARAi platform
3. Familiarize yourself with the [extension architecture](./extension-architecture.md)
4. Choose the appropriate [extension points](./extension-points.md) for your use case
5. Follow the [plugin development guide](./plugin-development-guide.md) to create your extension

## Extension Development Process

The general process for developing an extension for the VARAi platform is:

1. **Plan**: Identify the extension point and functionality you want to implement
2. **Develop**: Create the extension following the development guidelines
3. **Test**: Test the extension in a development environment
4. **Package**: Package the extension for deployment
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the extension to the VARAi platform
6. **Maintain**: Update and maintain the extension as needed

For more detailed information on each step, please refer to the specific guides linked above.
