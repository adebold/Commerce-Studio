# Enhanced Store Integration for SKU-Genie

## Overview

This PR implements the enhanced store integration for SKU-Genie, showcasing the advanced product data and features available through our platform. It builds upon the existing HTML store demo and adds new capabilities to leverage the enhanced data models we've implemented in the Shopify app integration.

## Features

### 1. API Integration

- Added a robust API client to fetch real-time product data from SKU-Genie
- Implemented fallback to mock data for development and testing
- Created data transformation functions to standardize API responses

### 2. Dynamic Face Shape Compatibility Visualization

- Added an interactive face shape visualizer that shows how frames look on different face shapes
- Implemented compatibility scoring display with visual indicators
- Created a virtual try-on feature that allows users to see frames on different face shapes
- Added navigation controls to browse products while in try-on mode

### 3. Shopify Connector

- Created a JavaScript library for easy integration with Shopify stores
- Implemented drop-in components using data attributes
- Added CSS styling for all enhanced elements
- Created documentation for Shopify theme developers
