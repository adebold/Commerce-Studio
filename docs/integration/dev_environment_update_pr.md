# Local Development Environment Update PR

## Overview
This PR addresses critical dependency conflicts in the local development environment and introduces a new approach to developing and testing the ML integration components without running the ML API server locally.

## Problem Addressed
The original approach for local development required running a local ML API server, which created dependency conflicts with:
- TypeScript version conflicts (project uses v5.7.3, but ML API requires v4.x)
- React-scripts compatibility issues
- Node module resolution problems
- Firebase dependencies

## Solution Implemented

### Alternative API Approaches
- Added httpbin.org integration for HTTP testing without ML functionality
- Configured staging API connection for real ML development
- Added comprehensive test scripts for API connectivity

### Firebase Mocking System
- Created a Firebase Admin mock implementation for local development
- Updated context management to use mocks in local mode
- Eliminated the need for Firebase credentials in local development

### Streamlined Local Development
- Added a comprehensive local development starter script
- Simplified environment configuration
- Improved error handling and diagnostics

## Key Files Changed/Added

### Scripts
- `scripts/start-local-dev.js` - New local development environment starter
- `scripts/test-httpbin.js` - HTTP testing with httpbin.org
- `scripts/test-ml-connection.js` - Test ML API connections

### Mocks and Implementation
- `src/webhook/mocks/firebase-admin-mock.js` - Firebase mock implementation
- `src/webhook/utils/context_management.js` - Updated to support local development mode

### Documentation
- `docs/integration/local_development_guide.md` - New detailed guide
- `docs/integration/local_development_reference.md` - Quick reference
- Updated README and integration guide with clear warnings

## Testing Completed
- Tested local development with httpbin.org
- Verified Firebase mocking functionality
- Confirmed staging API connectivity

## How to Use
Set up local development with:

```bash
# For HTTP testing only (no ML functionality)
node scripts/start-local-dev.js httpbin

# For ML functionality using staging
node scripts/start-local-dev.js staging
```
