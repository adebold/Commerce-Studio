# Shopify App Enhancements for SKU-Genie

## Overview

This PR implements the future improvements mentioned in the original Shopify App Integration PR. These enhancements significantly expand the capabilities of the Shopify integration, providing a more robust and feature-complete solution for synchronizing data between Shopify stores and the EyewearML platform.

## Enhancements

### 1. Collection Synchronization

- Added `Collection` model to store Shopify collection data
- Implemented collection synchronization service
- Added support for both smart and custom collections
- Integrated collection mapping between Shopify and SKU-Genie

### 2. Inventory Management

- Added `Inventory` model to track inventory levels across locations
- Implemented inventory synchronization service
- Added support for historical inventory tracking
- Integrated inventory updates with SKU-Genie

### 3. Advanced Conflict Resolution

- Added `ConflictResolution` model for tracking and resolving data conflicts
- Implemented sophisticated conflict detection system
- Added support for automatic conflict resolution based on conflict type and severity
- Created manual conflict resolution workflows
- Added version history for tracking conflict resolution

### 4. Performance Analytics

- Added `SyncMetrics` model for tracking synchronization performance
- Implemented detailed metrics collection for:
  - Sync jobs (success, failure, duration)
  - Resources (products, collections, inventory)
  - Conflicts (by type, resolution method)
  - API usage (requests, errors, response time)
  - Webhooks (by type, success rate)
- Added analytics API integration with SKU-Genie

### 5. Extended API Integration

- Enhanced SKU-Genie API service with new endpoints:
  - Collection management
  - Inventory management
  - Analytics retrieval

## Technical Details

### Collection Synchronization

The collection synchronization system supports both smart and custom collections from Shopify. Smart collections use rules to automatically include products, while custom collections have manually selected products.

Key features:
- Bidirectional sync of collection metadata
- Rule mapping between Shopify and SKU-Genie
- Product association tracking
- Collection image synchronization

### Inventory Management

The inventory system tracks stock levels across multiple locations and provides historical tracking of inventory changes.

Key features:
- Location-based inventory tracking
- Historical inventory records with change attribution
- Inventory policy synchronization
- Inventory conflict resolution

### Conflict Resolution System

The conflict resolution system detects data inconsistencies between Shopify and SKU-Genie and provides mechanisms for resolving them.

Key features:
- Multiple conflict types (data mismatch, deletion, creation, inventory)
- Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- Automatic resolution strategies based on conflict type and severity
- Manual resolution options with audit trail
- Field-level conflict detection and resolution

### Analytics System

The analytics system collects detailed metrics about the synchronization process to help identify issues and optimize performance.

Key features:
- Daily aggregation of sync metrics
- Performance tracking for API calls
- Error rate monitoring
- Webhook processing statistics
- Resource-specific metrics

## Testing

These enhancements have been tested with:
- Various collection types (smart, custom)
- Multi-location inventory scenarios
- Conflict scenarios of different types and severities
- High-volume synchronization jobs

## Future Work

While this PR implements significant enhancements, there are still opportunities for further improvements:

1. Real-time dashboard UI for monitoring sync status and analytics
2. More sophisticated conflict resolution algorithms using machine learning
3. Integration with order management systems
4. Enhanced notification system for critical conflicts
5. Performance optimizations for very large catalogs
