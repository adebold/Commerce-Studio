# Test-Driven Development Strategy for SPARC Phase 3.1

This document outlines the test-driven development (TDD) approach used for the SPARC Phase 3.1 Configuration Testing Framework, particularly focusing on the monitoring system components.

## TDD Philosophy

Our development follows strict TDD principles:

1. **RED**: Write failing tests first that define the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implement just enough code to make the tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code without changing functionality, ensuring tests still pass

This approach ensures:
- Clear requirements before implementation
- Higher quality code with fewer defects
- Better design through test-driven thinking
- Confidence in refactoring and optimization
- Documentation through test cases

## Testing Structure

```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and classes in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Fast execution for rapid feedback

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify system behavior as a whole
   - May involve actual network connections (with timeouts)

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Verify system meets performance requirements
   - Test database query performance
   - Test API response times

## Test Execution Workflow

We use a dedicated test runner script (`tests/run_tests.py`) that implements our TDD workflow:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py --all

# Run only unit tests (RED phase)
python tests/run_tests.py --unit

# Run only integration tests (GREEN phase)
python tests/run_tests.py --integration

# Generate coverage report (REFACTOR phase)
python tests/run_tests.py --all --coverage

# Increase verbosity for more detailed output
python tests/run_tests.py --verbose
```

### TDD Workflow Phases

1. **RED Phase**
   - Run unit tests expecting them to fail
   - Verify they fail for the expected reasons
   - Document the failing behavior

2. **GREEN Phase**
   - Implement the minimal code needed to pass tests
   - Run unit tests to verify they now pass
   - Run integration tests to verify component interactions

3. **REFACTOR Phase**
   - Improve code quality without changing behavior
   - Run coverage analysis to identify untested code
   - Add tests for any uncovered edge cases
   - Optimize performance where needed

## Writing New Tests

Follow these guidelines when writing new tests:

### Unit Test Structure

1. Use the `unittest` framework
2. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
   ```python
   def test_something(self):
       # Arrange - set up test data and conditions
       test_data = {...}
       
       # Act - call the function/method being tested
       result = function_under_test(test_data)
       
       # Assert - verify the result matches expectations
       self.assertEqual(expected_result, result)
   ```

3. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
   ```python
   def test_database_connection_fails_with_invalid_credentials(self):
       # Test implementation
   ```

4. Use mocks for external dependencies
   ```python
   @patch('module.external_dependency')
   def test_something(self, mock_dependency):
       mock_dependency.return_value = test_value
       # Test implementation
   ```

### Integration Test Structure

1. Set up realistic test environments
2. Test complete workflows
3. Verify end-to-end behavior
4. Clean up resources after tests

Example:
```python
def test_api_server_handles_database_failure(self):
    # Start API server
    # Configure mock database to fail
    # Make API request
    # Verify API returns appropriate error response
    # Verify error is logged correctly
    # Stop API server
```

## Continuous Integration

Our testing approach integrates with CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Pull Request Validation**
   - Run unit tests to catch basic issues early
   - Block merges if tests fail

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run full test suite including integration tests
   - Generate and publish coverage reports
   - Report test results to development team

3. **Deployment Gates**
   - Require minimum test coverage (80%)
   - Require all tests to pass
   - Verify performance tests meet thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

| Failure Type | Possible Causes | Resolution Steps |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Connection Errors | Network issues, services not running | Check service status, verify network connectivity |
| Timeout Errors | Slow services, inefficient code | Increase timeouts, optimize code, check resource usage |
| Intermittent Failures | Race conditions, resource conflicts | Add delays, improve resource management, isolate tests |
| Wrong Assertions | Implementation changes, incorrect expectations | Update tests to match new implementation, verify requirements |

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Increase Verbosity**
   ```bash
   python tests/run_tests.py --verbose --verbose
   ```

2. **Run Specific Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest tests.scripts.test_database_check.TestDatabaseChecker.test_specific_method
   ```

3. **Debug with IDE**
   - Set breakpoints in test code
   - Inspect variables during execution
   - Step through code execution

4. **Log Inspection**
   - Enable debug logging during tests
   - Analyze log output for clues
   - Compare logs between passing and failing runs

By following this testing strategy, we ensure high-quality code, clear documentation of expected behavior, and confidence in our ability to refactor and improve the system over time.
