# Conflict Resolution Workflow

This document provides detailed guidance for resolving each type of conflict in the repository. It complements the high-level plan in `merge-conflict-resolution-plan.md` by offering specific decision-making criteria and resolution strategies for each file type.

## Decision-Making Framework

When resolving conflicts, use the following decision-making framework:

1. **Functionality Preservation**: Does the resolution maintain all existing functionality?
2. **Feature Enhancement**: Does the resolution incorporate new features from both branches?
3. **Code Quality**: Does the resolution maintain or improve code quality?
4. **Naming Consistency**: Does the resolution maintain consistent naming conventions?
5. **Security Implications**: Does the resolution maintain or enhance security?

## File-Specific Resolution Guidelines

### Infrastructure Configuration Files

#### Dockerfile & frontend/Dockerfile

**Key considerations:**
- Service definitions and dependencies
- Base images and versions
- Build stages and optimization
- Environment variables
- Health checks and monitoring

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare the service architecture in both versions
2. Identify new services or components added in either branch
3. Ensure all services from both branches are included
4. Standardize base images and versions
5. Consolidate build optimizations
6. Ensure consistent health check implementations

#### docker-compose.yml

**Key considerations:**
- Service dependencies and relationships
- Volume mappings
- Network configurations
- Environment variables
- Resource constraints

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare service definitions from both branches
2. Ensure all services are properly connected
3. Validate volume mappings for data persistence
4. Check for environment variable conflicts
5. Ensure consistent resource allocation

### Dependency Management Files

#### package.json & frontend/package.json

**Key considerations:**
- Dependency version conflicts
- New dependencies added in either branch
- Scripts and commands
- Project metadata

**Resolution approach:**
1. For each dependency, choose the newer version unless there's a compatibility issue
2. Include all unique dependencies from both branches
3. Merge scripts, preferring the more comprehensive implementation
4. Update project metadata to reflect the current state

#### requirements.txt

**Key considerations:**
- Python package version conflicts
- New dependencies added in either branch
- Compatibility between packages

**Resolution approach:**
1. For each package, choose the newer version unless there's a compatibility issue
2. Include all unique packages from both branches
3. Verify compatibility between packages
4. Consider pinning versions for stability

### Frontend Components

#### AuthProvider.tsx & LoginForm.tsx

**Key considerations:**
- Authentication flow changes
- Role-based access control
- Error handling
- UI/UX improvements

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare authentication flows in both versions
2. Ensure all roles and permissions are preserved
3. Incorporate improved error handling from either branch
4. Maintain consistent UI/UX patterns
5. Verify integration with backend authentication

#### Service Files (auth.ts & commerce-studio.ts)

**Key considerations:**
- API endpoint changes
- Data transformation logic
- Error handling
- Authentication mechanisms

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare API endpoints and ensure all are included
2. Verify data transformation logic is consistent
3. Incorporate improved error handling
4. Ensure authentication mechanisms are properly implemented
5. Check for security improvements

### Backend API Files

#### config.py

**Key considerations:**
- Configuration parameters
- Environment variable handling
- Security settings
- Default values

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare configuration parameters from both branches
2. Include all unique parameters
3. Ensure consistent environment variable handling
4. Verify security settings are not compromised
5. Check for appropriate default values

#### Router Files

**Key considerations:**
- API endpoint definitions
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling
- Authentication and authorization

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare endpoint definitions from both branches
2. Ensure all endpoints are included
3. Verify request validation is consistent
4. Check response formatting for consistency
5. Incorporate improved error handling
6. Ensure proper authentication and authorization

#### Model Files

**Key considerations:**
- Data model changes
- Relationships between models
- Validation rules
- Database schema implications

**Resolution approach:**
1. Compare model definitions from both branches
2. Ensure all fields and relationships are preserved
3. Verify validation rules are consistent
4. Check for database schema implications
5. Ensure backward compatibility

### E-commerce Integration

#### apps/woocommerce/eyewearml.php

**Key considerations:**
- Naming convention changes (VARAi vs EyewearML)
- Plugin functionality
- WordPress hooks and filters
- Integration with the core platform

**Resolution approach:**
1. Decide on a consistent naming convention (likely VARAi based on other files)
2. Ensure all plugin functionality is preserved
3. Verify WordPress hooks and filters are properly implemented
4. Check integration with the core platform
5. Ensure consistent error handling and logging

## Conflict Resolution Process for Each File

For each conflicted file, follow this process:

1. **Understand the conflict**
   - Identify the conflicting sections
   - Understand the purpose of each change
   - Determine if changes are complementary or contradictory

2. **Apply the decision-making framework**
   - Evaluate each change against the framework criteria
   - Determine which changes to keep or merge

3. **Implement the resolution**
   - Edit the file to resolve the conflict
   - Ensure the file is syntactically correct
   - Maintain consistent coding style

4. **Validate the resolution**
   - Verify the file compiles/parses correctly
   - Run relevant tests if available
   - Check for integration issues with other components

5. **Document the resolution**
   - Note any significant decisions made
   - Document any potential implications

## Special Cases

### Generated Files (__pycache__)

For Python bytecode files (.pyc), the recommended approach is:

1. Delete all .pyc files in the conflicted directories
2. Allow Python to regenerate them during the next run
3. Do not manually resolve conflicts in these files

### Large JSON Files (package-lock.json)

For large, automatically generated JSON files:

1. Consider regenerating the file rather than manually resolving conflicts
2. For package-lock.json, consider running `npm install` after resolving package.json
3. Verify the regenerated file works correctly

## Testing After Resolution

After resolving conflicts in a category of files, perform the following tests:

1. **Infrastructure Configuration**
   - Build and run the Docker containers
   - Verify all services start correctly
   - Check health endpoints

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Install dependencies
   - Verify no version conflicts
   - Check for deprecation warnings

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Build the frontend
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify UI components render correctly

4. **Backend API**
   - Start the API server
   - Test endpoints with Postman or curl
   - Verify database interactions

5. **E-commerce Integration**
   - Test the WooCommerce plugin in a WordPress environment
   - Verify product recommendations
   - Test virtual try-on functionality

## Conclusion

By following this detailed workflow, you can systematically resolve conflicts while ensuring the integrity and functionality of the codebase. Remember to document significant decisions and test thoroughly after each resolution.
