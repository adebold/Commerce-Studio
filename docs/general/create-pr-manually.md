4. Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `feature/architecture-enhancement`.
5. Click on the "Create pull request" button.
6. Set the title to "VARAi Commerce Studio Architecture Enhancement".
7. Copy and paste the content from `VARAi-Commerce-Studio-Architecture-PR.md` into the description field.
8. Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit.
