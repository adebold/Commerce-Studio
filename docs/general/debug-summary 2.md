# Debugging Summary: SQLAlchemy Table Definition Issue

## Issue Identified

The API server was failing to start with the following error:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Table 'notifications' is already defined for this MetaData instance. Specify 'extend_existing=True' to redefine options and columns on an existing Table object.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the code, I determined that the issue was caused by the `notifications` table being defined multiple times in the codebase. This can happen due to:

1. Multiple modules importing the same model
2. Circular imports leading to the model being loaded twice
3. The same table name being used in different models

## Solution Implemented

I fixed the issue by adding `extend_existing=True` to the table definitions in `src/api/models/db_notification_models.py`:

```python
class Notification(Base):
    """Notification model for the database."""
    __tablename__ = "notifications"
    __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}
    
    # ... rest of the class definition
```

This parameter tells SQLAlchemy to extend the existing table definition rather than trying to create a new one, which resolves the conflict.

I applied the same fix to the other notification-related models:
- `NotificationTemplate`
- `NotificationPreference`

## Additional Improvements

To make it easier to deploy and test the solution, I also:

1. Created a Docker setup for the HTML store demo
   - Added a Dockerfile for the HTML store
   - Added a docker-compose.yml file for the HTML store

2. Added scripts to run the HTML store demo
   - `run-demo.ps1` for Windows
   - `run-demo.sh` for Linux/macOS

3. Added scripts to restart the API server Docker containers
   - `restart-api-server.ps1` for Windows
   - `restart-api-server.sh` for Linux/macOS

## Deployment Instructions

### Restarting the API Server

To apply the SQLAlchemy fix, restart the Docker containers for the API server:

**Windows**:
```
.\restart-api-server.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS**:
```
chmod +x restart-api-server.sh
./restart-api-server.sh
```

### Running the HTML Store Demo

To run the HTML store demo:

**Windows**:
```
cd apps/html-store
.\run-demo.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS**:
```
cd apps/html-store
chmod +x run-demo.sh
./run-demo.sh
```

## Verification

After restarting the Docker containers, the API server should start without errors, and the notification functionality should work as expected.

You can verify the fix by checking the Docker logs:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```

If the fix is successful, you should no longer see the SQLAlchemy error about the `notifications` table being already defined.
