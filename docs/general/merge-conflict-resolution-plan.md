# Merge Conflict Resolution Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to review and resolve the unmerged changes in the repository. The merge has resulted in conflicts across multiple files spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and integration components.

## Conflict Categories

Based on the analysis of unmerged files, we can categorize the conflicts into the following groups:

1. **Infrastructure Configuration**
   - Dockerfile
   - docker-compose.yml
   - frontend/Dockerfile

2. **Dependency Management**
   - frontend/package.json
   - frontend/package-lock.json
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json
   - requirements.txt

3. **Frontend Components**
   - frontend/src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx
   - frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
   - frontend/src/services/auth.ts
   - frontend/src/services/commerce-studio.ts

4. **Backend API**
   - src/api/core/config.py
   - src/api/dependencies/__init__.py
   - src/api/main.py
   - src/api/models/analytics.py
   - src/api/routers/__init__.py
   - src/api/routers/analytics.py
   - src/api/routers/recommendations.py

5. **E-commerce Integration**
   - apps/woocommerce/eyewearml.php

6. **Compiled/Generated Files**
   - src/api/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/__pycache__/main.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/dependencies/__pycache__/auth.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/models/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/models/__pycache__/base.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/models/__pycache__/recommendations.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/routers/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/routers/__pycache__/recommendations.cpython-311.pyc
   - src/api/services/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc

## Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Create a backup branch**
   ```bash
   git branch backup-merge-conflict
   ```

2. **Identify merge base**
   ```bash
   git merge-base HEAD MERGE_HEAD
   ```

3. **Set up a clean working environment**
   - Ensure all necessary development tools are available
   - Prepare testing environment for validating changes

### Phase 2: Resolve Infrastructure Conflicts

1. **Review and resolve Dockerfile conflicts**
   - Compare changes to understand architectural modifications
   - Ensure all services are properly configured
   - Validate health checks and port configurations

2. **Review and resolve docker-compose.yml conflicts**
   - Ensure service dependencies are correctly defined
   - Validate volume mappings and network configurations
   - Check environment variable configurations

### Phase 3: Resolve Dependency Conflicts

1. **Review and resolve package.json conflicts**
   - Compare dependency versions
   - Identify new dependencies added in both branches
   - Resolve conflicts by selecting the most recent compatible versions

2. **Review and resolve requirements.txt conflicts**
   - Compare Python dependency versions
   - Ensure compatibility between dependencies
   - Update to latest stable versions where appropriate

### Phase 4: Resolve Frontend Conflicts

1. **Review and resolve AuthProvider.tsx conflicts**
   - Understand authentication flow changes
   - Ensure role-based access control is properly implemented
   - Validate integration with backend authentication services

2. **Review and resolve LoginForm.tsx conflicts**
   - Ensure form validation is consistent
   - Validate error handling
   - Check for UI/UX improvements

3. **Review and resolve service conflicts**
   - Ensure API endpoints are correctly configured
   - Validate error handling and response processing
   - Check for security improvements

### Phase 5: Resolve Backend API Conflicts

1. **Review and resolve config.py conflicts**
   - Compare configuration parameters
   - Ensure environment variables are properly handled
   - Validate security settings

2. **Review and resolve router conflicts**
   - Ensure API endpoints are consistent
   - Validate request/response handling
   - Check for new features or improvements

3. **Review and resolve model conflicts**
   - Ensure data models are consistent
   - Validate relationships between models
   - Check for schema changes

### Phase 6: Resolve E-commerce Integration Conflicts

1. **Review and resolve WooCommerce plugin conflicts**
   - Address naming convention differences (VARAi vs EyewearML)
   - Ensure plugin functionality is preserved
   - Validate hooks and filters

### Phase 7: Handle Generated Files

1. **Regenerate all __pycache__ files**
   - Delete all .pyc files
   - Allow Python to regenerate them during the next run

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation

1. **Unit testing**
   - Run unit tests for each component
   - Ensure all tests pass after conflict resolution

2. **Integration testing**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Validate end-to-end workflows

3. **Manual testing**
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Verify visual elements and interactions

### Phase 9: Finalization

1. **Commit the resolved conflicts**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

2. **Create documentation**
   - Document significant changes
   - Note any architectural decisions made during conflict resolution

## Conflict Resolution Guidelines

When resolving conflicts, follow these principles:

1. **Preserve functionality**: Ensure that all features continue to work after resolution
2. **Maintain consistency**: Use consistent naming conventions and coding styles
3. **Choose the most recent code**: When in doubt, prefer the most recent implementation
4. **Consider security implications**: Ensure security features are not compromised
5. **Document decisions**: Record the rationale for non-trivial conflict resolutions

## Tools and Commands

### Git Commands for Conflict Resolution

- View current conflicts:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- View diff of conflicted file:
  ```bash
  git diff <filename>
  ```

- Get version from current branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout --ours <filename>
  ```

- Get version from the branch being merged:
  ```bash
  git checkout --theirs <filename>
  ```

- After resolving a conflict:
  ```bash
  git add <filename>
  ```

- Abort the merge:
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```

### Visual Diff Tools

- VS Code's built-in merge conflict resolver
- GitLens extension for enhanced Git capabilities
- Beyond Compare or other external diff tools

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to resolving the merge conflicts in the repository. By following this systematic process, we can ensure that all conflicts are properly addressed while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the codebase.
