# Post-Merge Testing Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy to validate the application after resolving merge conflicts. The goal is to ensure that all functionality works correctly and that no regressions were introduced during the conflict resolution process.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all affected components and their interactions
2. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus more effort on high-risk areas
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test components as conflicts are resolved
4. **Automated + Manual**: Combine automated tests with manual verification
5. **Cross-Functional Validation**: Involve team members from different disciplines

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Component-Level Testing

Test individual components immediately after resolving conflicts in their files.

#### Infrastructure Components

- **Docker Builds**
  - Verify all Docker images build successfully
  - Check for any build warnings or errors
  - Validate image sizes are reasonable

- **Docker Compose**
  - Validate docker-compose.yml with `docker-compose config`
  - Test service startup with `docker-compose up`
  - Verify service dependencies and networking

#### Frontend Components

- **Build Verification**
  - Ensure the frontend builds without errors: `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Check for TypeScript/ESLint warnings

- **Unit Tests**
  - Run frontend unit tests: `cd frontend && npm test`
  - Focus on components with resolved conflicts

- **Component Testing**
  - Test authentication components in isolation
  - Verify form validation in LoginForm
  - Test service modules with mock API responses

#### Backend Components

- **Syntax Validation**
  - Verify Python files parse correctly: `python -m py_compile <file>`
  - Check for linting issues: `flake8 <file>`

- **Unit Tests**
  - Run backend unit tests: `pytest src/api/tests/`
  - Focus on modules with resolved conflicts

- **API Endpoint Testing**
  - Test individual endpoints with Postman or curl
  - Verify request/response formats
  - Check error handling

#### E-commerce Integration

- **Plugin Validation**
  - Verify PHP syntax: `php -l apps/woocommerce/eyewearml.php`
  - Check WordPress coding standards

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

Test interactions between components after all conflicts in a category are resolved.

#### Authentication Flow

- **Login Process**
  - Test user login with valid credentials
  - Verify token generation and storage
  - Test login with invalid credentials
  - Verify error messages

- **Authorization**
  - Test role-based access control
  - Verify protected route access
  - Test permission-based UI rendering

#### Recommendation Engine

- **API Integration**
  - Test recommendation API endpoints
  - Verify data flow from backend to frontend
  - Check caching mechanisms

- **UI Rendering**
  - Verify recommendation display in UI
  - Test filtering and sorting
  - Check responsive behavior

#### Virtual Try-On

- **Image Processing**
  - Test image upload functionality
  - Verify face detection
  - Check frame overlay accuracy

- **User Experience**
  - Test the try-on interface
  - Verify frame switching
  - Check view angle adjustments

#### Analytics

- **Event Tracking**
  - Verify event capture
  - Test data transmission
  - Check storage and retrieval

- **Reporting**
  - Test report generation
  - Verify data visualization
  - Check export functionality

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

Perform comprehensive testing of complete user journeys after all conflicts are resolved.

#### User Journeys

- **New User Onboarding**
  1. User registration
  2. Profile creation
  3. Initial recommendations
  4. First virtual try-on
  5. Product selection

- **Returning User Experience**
  1. User login
  2. View saved recommendations
  3. Try new frames
  4. Update preferences
  5. View updated recommendations

- **Admin Workflows**
  1. Admin login
  2. View analytics dashboard
  3. Adjust recommendation settings
  4. Manage product catalog
  5. View user feedback

#### Cross-Browser Testing

- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check for visual consistency

#### Performance Testing

- **Load Time Measurement**
  - Measure initial page load time
  - Test component rendering speed
  - Verify API response times

- **Resource Utilization**
  - Monitor CPU and memory usage
  - Check for memory leaks
  - Verify efficient resource cleanup

### Phase 4: Regression Testing

Verify that existing functionality continues to work correctly.

#### Automated Regression Suite

- Run the full automated test suite
- Compare test results with pre-merge baseline
- Investigate any new failures

#### Critical Path Testing

- Test business-critical workflows
- Verify core functionality
- Check integration points

#### Edge Case Verification

- Test boundary conditions
- Verify error handling
- Check recovery mechanisms

## Testing Environments

### Local Development

- Used for initial component testing
- Quick feedback loop
- Isolated environment

### Integration Environment

- Deployed with all services
- Shared database
- Mimics production configuration

### Staging Environment

- Production-like environment
- Used for final validation
- Performance testing

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing

- **Frontend**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Backend**: Pytest, Postman collections
- **E2E**: Playwright or Cypress
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest

### Manual Testing

- Exploratory testing sessions
- Usability testing
- Visual inspection

## Test Documentation

### Test Plans

- Create test plans for each component
- Define test scenarios and expected results
- Assign testing responsibilities

### Test Reports

- Document test execution results
- Track pass/fail status
- Record issues found

### Issue Tracking

- Log bugs in issue tracking system
- Include reproduction steps
- Prioritize based on severity

## Acceptance Criteria

The merge can be considered successfully tested when:

1. All automated tests pass
2. No critical or high-severity bugs are found
3. All user journeys can be completed successfully
4. Performance metrics meet or exceed baseline
5. Cross-browser compatibility is verified

## Rollback Plan

In case critical issues are discovered:

1. Document the issue and impact
2. Attempt targeted fixes if possible
3. If issues cannot be resolved quickly, prepare for rollback:
   - Restore from the backup branch
   - Reapply critical fixes from the merge
   - Deploy the rollback version
   - Schedule a new merge attempt

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

After successful testing and deployment:

1. Monitor application performance
2. Watch for error rates and exceptions
3. Track user engagement metrics
4. Collect feedback from early users

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to validating the application after merge conflict resolution. By following this structured process, the team can ensure that the merged codebase maintains functionality, performance, and quality.

Remember that testing is not just about finding bugs but about building confidence in the merged codebase. Thorough testing now will prevent issues in production and provide a solid foundation for future development.
