## Introduction

This document outlines the compliance measures implemented within the EyewearML platform to ensure adherence to various regulatory requirements, including GDPR, healthcare data regulations, and data residency requirements. The platform is designed with a "compliance-by-design" approach, integrating regulatory considerations into the architecture and implementation from the ground up.

## GDPR Compliance

The EyewearML platform implements comprehensive measures to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union.

### EU Region Deployment

- All services are deployed in EU-specific regions to ensure data processing occurs within EU boundaries
- The platform uses Google Cloud's `eu-west1` and other EU regions for European customers
- Regional isolation is enforced through infrastructure-as-code using Terraform

### Data Subject Rights Implementation

The platform provides dedicated endpoints to fulfill data subject rights as required by GDPR:

- **Right to Access**: `/api/user/data/export` endpoint allows users to download all their personal data
- **Right to Erasure**: `/api/user/data/delete` endpoint enables users to request deletion of their data
- **Right to Rectification**: User profile management interfaces allow correction of personal information
- **Right to Restriction**: Settings for limiting data processing are available in user preferences

### Privacy Policy and Consent Management

- Comprehensive privacy policy available at `/privacy-policy` on all regional deployments
- Cookie consent mechanism implemented on all user-facing interfaces
- Explicit consent collection for all data processing activities
- Granular consent options allowing users to select specific processing activities

### Data Protection Impact Assessment

- Regular DPIAs conducted for new features and processing activities
- Documentation of data flows and processing purposes
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies implemented

## Healthcare Data Regulations

The EyewearML platform handles prescription data and biometric information, which may be subject to healthcare regulations in various jurisdictions.

### Encryption and Security

- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implementation of security headers:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `X-XSS-Protection`
- CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys) option available for enterprise customers

### Prescription Data Handling

- Secure endpoints for prescription data with strict access controls
- Authentication and authorization required for all prescription data access
- Encryption of prescription data with healthcare-grade security measures
- Compliance with relevant electronic health record regulations

### Biometric Data Protection

- Explicit consent required for face analysis and virtual try-on features
- Biometric data processing limited to the specific purpose consented to
- Option to use the service without biometric data collection
- Temporary storage with automatic deletion after processing

## Data Residency Requirements

The EyewearML platform is designed to meet data residency requirements across different regions.

### Regional Data Storage

- Data is stored in the region where it is collected
- Infrastructure deployed across multiple regions (US, EU) to support data residency requirements
- Region-specific environment variables and configurations
- Terraform-managed regional deployments with appropriate settings

### Cross-Region Data Transfer Controls

- Strict controls on cross-region data transfers
- API endpoints enforce region-specific data access
- Headers like `X-Data-Region` and `X-Target-Region` control data access
- Blocking of unauthorized cross-region data access attempts

### Regional Service Deployment

- Services deployed independently in each region
- Region-specific secrets and configurations
- Regional domain mapping for appropriate routing
- VPC connectors configured per region for secure networking

## Audit Logging Implementation

The EyewearML platform implements comprehensive audit logging to track all data access and system activities.

### Audit Log Collection

- All data access events are logged with detailed information
- User actions are tracked with timestamps and contextual information
- Administrative activities are logged with enhanced detail
- System events and errors are captured for security analysis

### Audit Log Management

- Centralized audit log storage with appropriate retention periods
- Access controls for audit log viewing and management
- Immutable audit logs to prevent tampering
- Regular audit log reviews for security and compliance purposes

### Compliance Reporting

- `/api/admin/audit-logs` endpoint for accessing audit information
- `/api/admin/compliance-reports` for generating compliance documentation
- Automated reporting capabilities for regulatory submissions
- Custom report generation for specific compliance needs

## Compliance Testing

The EyewearML platform includes automated compliance testing to verify that all regulatory requirements are met.

### Automated Compliance Tests

The platform includes a comprehensive test suite (`tests/compliance/test_cloud_run_compliance.py`) that verifies:

- GDPR compliance features
- Healthcare data protection measures
- Data residency implementation
- Audit logging functionality

### Test Coverage

The compliance test suite covers:

- Regional service availability
- Data subject rights endpoints
- Privacy policy accessibility
- Cookie consent mechanisms
- Encryption and security headers
- Prescription data endpoint security
- Biometric data consent requirements
- Region-specific data storage
- Cross-region data transfer controls
- Audit logging endpoints
- Data access logging

### Continuous Compliance Verification

- Compliance tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
- Regular scheduled compliance testing
- Automated alerts for compliance test failures
- Compliance test reports for audit purposes

## Regional Deployments
