    *   Integrate with Vertex AI using the existing code in the `src/Vertex-ai` and `src\varai\vertex_ai_integration` directories.
    *   Utilize the `src\dialogflow` directory for conversation management and intent detection.
    *   Implement the necessary API endpoints for each AI-powered app.
    *   Implement metered billing for each AI-powered app.
    *   Integrate the AI models with the reporting module.
    *   Create visualizations for the AI-powered analytics.

3.  **Plugin Marketplace**:
    *   Design the architecture for the plugin marketplace, including support for metered billing.

    *   Implement security measures to prevent malicious plugins.

4.  **Developer Portal**:
    *   Design the structure and content of the developer portal.
    *   Create documentation for the platform API, including the plugin API and the AI-powered features API.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for API access.
    *   Provide tools for testing and debugging API integrations.
