# Git Merge Conflict Best Practices

This document provides best practices and techniques for effectively resolving Git merge conflicts, particularly in complex codebases like the VARAi platform.

## Understanding Merge Conflicts

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile differences between two commits. This typically happens when:

1. **Concurrent modifications**: Two branches modify the same part of a file
2. **Deleted in one, modified in another**: A file is deleted in one branch but modified in another
3. **Added in both branches**: A file is added in both branches with different content

## Before Resolving Conflicts

### 1. Understand the Context

Before diving into conflict resolution:

- Review the commit history of both branches to understand the purpose of changes
- Communicate with the authors of the conflicting changes if possible
- Understand the architectural implications of both changes

### 2. Create a Safe Environment

- Create a backup branch before attempting to resolve conflicts:
  ```bash
  git branch backup-merge-conflict
  ```
- Consider using a dedicated development environment for conflict resolution
- Ensure you have the latest versions of both branches

### 3. Plan Your Approach

- Categorize conflicts by type (infrastructure, dependencies, frontend, backend, etc.)
- Prioritize conflicts based on dependencies (resolve core components first)
- Decide whether to resolve conflicts one by one or in batches by category

## Conflict Resolution Techniques

### 1. Using Git Commands

#### View conflicted files:
```bash
git status
```

#### Examine a specific conflict:
```bash
git diff <filename>
```

#### Choose one version entirely:
```bash
# Keep the version from your current branch
git checkout --ours <filename>

# Keep the version from the branch being merged
git checkout --theirs <filename>
```

#### After resolving a conflict:
```bash
git add <filename>
```

#### Abort the merge if needed:
```bash
git merge --abort
```

### 2. Using Visual Tools

#### VS Code's built-in merge conflict resolver:
1. Open the conflicted file in VS Code
2. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Use the "Accept Current Change", "Accept Incoming Change", "Accept Both Changes", or "Compare Changes" options

#### GitLens extension:
1. Provides enhanced visualization of conflicts
2. Shows the commit history for each conflicting section
3. Offers more context for making informed decisions

#### External diff tools:
1. Configure Git to use your preferred diff tool:
   ```bash
   git config --global merge.tool <toolname>
   ```
2. Launch the tool for conflict resolution:
   ```bash
   git mergetool
   ```

## Strategies for Specific File Types

### 1. Source Code Files

- Preserve functionality from both branches when possible
- Maintain consistent coding style and patterns
- Consider refactoring to accommodate both changes
- Add comments explaining complex merge decisions

### 2. Configuration Files

- Ensure all configuration parameters from both branches are included
- Verify that the merged configuration is valid
- Test the configuration in a development environment

### 3. Package Dependencies

- Choose the newer version of dependencies unless there's a compatibility issue
- Include all unique dependencies from both branches
- Regenerate lock files after resolving package.json conflicts

### 4. Generated Files

- Generally, prefer to regenerate these files rather than manually resolving conflicts
- For Python bytecode (.pyc files), delete and let Python regenerate them
- For large JSON files like package-lock.json, resolve the source file (package.json) and regenerate

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chunk-by-Chunk Resolution

For large files with multiple conflicts:

1. Resolve one conflict chunk at a time
2. Test after resolving each chunk if possible
3. Commit incrementally if the merge is particularly complex

### 2. Temporary Branches for Experimentation

1. Create a temporary branch from your conflicted state:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b temp-conflict-resolution
   ```
2. Experiment with different resolution approaches
3. If satisfied, apply the same resolutions to your original branch
4. If not, discard the temporary branch and try again

### 3. Interactive Rebase to Simplify Conflicts

If one branch has many small commits that conflict with another branch:

1. Consider rebasing and squashing commits before merging:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <base-branch>
   ```
2. This can reduce the number of conflicts to resolve

## Testing After Conflict Resolution

### 1. Compile and Build

- Ensure the code compiles/builds successfully
- Fix any syntax errors introduced during conflict resolution

### 2. Run Tests

- Run unit tests for affected components
- Run integration tests to verify component interactions
- Perform manual testing of critical functionality

### 3. Verify Functionality

- Test the specific features that were modified in both branches
- Ensure no regressions were introduced
- Verify that the merged code meets all requirements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Blindly Accepting Changes

- Never accept changes without understanding their purpose
- Avoid using `--ours` or `--theirs` for entire directories without review

### 2. Ignoring Whitespace and Formatting

- Pay attention to indentation and formatting
- Inconsistent formatting can lead to syntax errors
- Use `git diff -w` to ignore whitespace when reviewing changes

### 3. Forgetting to Test

- Always test after resolving conflicts
- Don't assume functionality is preserved just because the code compiles

### 4. Losing Track of Progress

- Mark files as resolved using `git add` as you go
- Use `git status` frequently to track progress
- Consider using a checklist for complex merges

## Documenting Conflict Resolution

### 1. Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages that:
- Indicate that conflicts were resolved
- Summarize the approach taken
- Mention any significant decisions made

Example:
```
Resolve merge conflicts in authentication components

- Preserved new role-based access control from feature branch
- Kept improved error handling from master branch
- Refactored AuthProvider to accommodate both changes
```

### 2. Code Comments

Add comments in the code to explain non-obvious resolution decisions:

```typescript
// MERGE NOTE: Combined the role checking logic from both branches
// to preserve the new roles while maintaining backward compatibility
```

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Update relevant documentation to reflect merged changes
- Document any architectural decisions made during conflict resolution
- Consider creating an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for significant changes

## Conclusion

Resolving merge conflicts is both a technical and communication challenge. By following these best practices, you can approach conflict resolution systematically and minimize the risk of introducing bugs or regressions.

Remember that the goal is not just to resolve the syntax conflicts, but to ensure that the merged code preserves the intent and functionality of both branches while maintaining the overall integrity of the codebase.
