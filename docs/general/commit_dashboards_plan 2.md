# Plan to Commit Dashboard Files

**Findings:**

*   The dashboard files (`ClientAdminDashboard.tsx`, `SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`, `BrandManagerDashboard.tsx`, and `ViewerDashboard.tsx`) exist in the `frontend/src/components/dashboard/` directory.
*   The dashboard components are imported and used in `frontend/src/routes.tsx`, indicating they are integrated into the application's routing.
*   A search of the repository only found the dashboard filenames in `dashboard_implementation_plan.md`, suggesting the files are not yet committed to the main branch.

**Proposed Plan:**

1.  **Commit the dashboard files:** Use `git add` to stage the dashboard files for commit.
2.  **Commit the changes:** Use `git commit` to commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "feat: Add dashboard components").
3.  **Push the changes:** Use `git push` to push the changes to the main branch.
