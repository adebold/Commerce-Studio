## Introduction to Virtual Try-On

VARAi's virtual try-on technology allows you to see how eyewear frames look on your face using augmented reality (AR) technology. This helps you make more confident purchasing decisions without having to physically try on frames in a store.

### Benefits of Virtual Try-On

- Try on hundreds of frames from the comfort of your home
- See how frames look from different angles
- Compare multiple frames side-by-side
- Share images with friends and family for feedback
- Get personalized recommendations based on your face shape and preferences

### How It Works

VARAi uses advanced computer vision and augmented reality technology to:

1. Analyze your face shape, features, and dimensions
2. Create a 3D model of your face
3. Overlay 3D models of eyewear frames onto your face
4. Adjust the frames to fit your face realistically
5. Allow you to view the frames from different angles
