# Practice Management System (PMS) Integrations

## Overview

This documentation covers integrations between Practice Studio and various third-party Practice Management Systems (PMS). These integrations allow Practice Studio to exchange data with existing PMS software, enabling seamless workflows for healthcare providers.

## Integration Approach

Practice Studio offers multiple integration methods:

1. **API-Based Integration**: Real-time, bidirectional data exchange through RESTful APIs
2. **File-Based Integration**: Scheduled import/export of data through standardized file formats
3. **HL7 Integration**: Healthcare-specific protocol for clinical data exchange
4. **FHIR Integration**: Modern healthcare data standard for interoperability

## Supported PMS Systems

Practice Studio currently supports integration with the following PMS systems:

| PMS System | Integration Methods | Status |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Epic | API, FHIR | Operational |
| Cerner | API, HL7, FHIR | Operational |
| Allscripts | API, File-Based | Operational |
| athenahealth | API, FHIR | Operational |
| eClinicalWorks | API, File-Based | Operational |
| NextGen | API, HL7 | Operational |
| Meditech | HL7, FHIR | Operational |
| DrChrono | API | Operational |
| Kareo | API | Operational |
| Practice Fusion | API | Operational |

## Integration Capabilities

The following data can be exchanged through our integrations:

- **Patient Demographics**: Registration and contact information
- **Appointments**: Scheduling and management
- **Clinical Records**: Medical history, diagnoses, and treatments
- **Billing Information**: Claims, payments, and insurance details
- **Provider Information**: Practitioner details and credentials
- **Inventory**: Medical supplies and equipment tracking

## Integration Architecture

Our integration architecture follows a secure, standardized approach:

1. **Authentication Layer**: OAuth 2.0 or API key-based authentication
2. **Integration Engine**: Handles data transformation and routing
3. **Validation Layer**: Ensures data integrity and consistency
4. **API Gateway**: Manages rate limiting and access control
5. **Audit System**: Tracks all data exchanges for compliance

## Implementation Process

The typical integration implementation process includes:

1. **Discovery**: Assess specific PMS requirements and capabilities
2. **Design**: Create a detailed integration plan
3. **Development**: Implement integration components
4. **Testing**: Validate data flow in test environments
5. **Deployment**: Roll out to production
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of integration health

## Security Considerations

All PMS integrations follow strict security protocols:

- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- Minimum necessary data access principles
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and other relevant regulations
- Detailed access logging and monitoring
