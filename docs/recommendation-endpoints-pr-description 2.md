# Pull Request: Implement Recommendation Endpoints with FastAPI

## Overview

This PR implements a complete set of recommendation endpoints for the Eyewear ML project, providing a robust API for personalized, popular, trending, and similar product recommendations. The implementation follows best practices for API design and includes comprehensive documentation and testing.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored product recommendations based on user preferences and behavior
- **Popular Recommendations**: Products that are popular within a specified time frame
- **Trending Recommendations**: Products that are rapidly gaining popularity
- **Similar Product Recommendations**: Products that are similar to a specified product
- **Feedback Submission**: Endpoint for collecting user feedback on recommendations

## Technical Implementation

- Created Pydantic models for request and response data validation
- Implemented FastAPI route handlers with appropriate error handling
- Developed a recommendation service with mock implementations for testing
- Added multi-tenant support with tenant ID validation
- Included comprehensive API documentation using FastAPI's built-in features
- Created a test suite to verify API functionality

## Files Added/Modified

- `src/api/models/recommendation_models.py`: Pydantic models for request/response data
- `src/api/services/recommendation_service.py`: Service for generating recommendations
- `src/api/routers/recommendations.py`: FastAPI route handlers
- `src/api/config.py`: Configuration settings
- `src/api/database.py`: Database models and operations
- `src/api/dependencies.py`: Authentication and other dependencies
- `src/api/main.py`: Updated to include recommendation routes
- `tests/api/test_recommendations.py`: Tests for the recommendation API
- `docs/recommendation-endpoints-implementation-plan.md`: Implementation plan

## Next Steps

- Implement actual recommendation algorithms (currently using mock data)
- Add caching for improved performance
- Integrate with actual product data from the database
- Implement A/B testing for recommendation strategies
- Add analytics to track recommendation effectiveness

## Testing

The PR includes a test suite that verifies:
- All endpoints return the expected response format
- Authentication and authorization are working correctly
- Error handling is functioning as expected

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/api/test_recommendations.py
```
