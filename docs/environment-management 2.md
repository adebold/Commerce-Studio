# VARAi Environment Management System

This document provides comprehensive information about the environment management system for the VARAi platform, including configuration management, environment promotion, monitoring, scaling, disaster recovery, and documentation.

## 1. Environment Configuration Management

The VARAi platform uses a centralized environment configuration system that provides consistent configuration across different deployment environments (development, staging, production).

### 1.1 Configuration Structure

The configuration system is organized into the following components:

- **Environment-specific configuration files**: Located in `config/environments/` directory
- **Feature flags**: Control feature availability across environments
- **Secrets management**: Secure storage and access to sensitive information
- **Configuration validation**: Ensures configuration integrity before deployment
- **Configuration versioning**: Tracks changes to configuration over time

### 1.2 Using Environment Configuration

```python
from src.config.environment import get_current_environment, get_config, is_feature_enabled

# Get current environment
env = get_current_environment()

# Get configuration for current environment
config = get_config()

# Check if a feature is enabled
if is_feature_enabled("new_recommendation_engine"):
    # Use new recommendation engine
    ...
else:
    # Use legacy recommendation engine
    ...
```

### 1.3 Secret Management

Secrets are managed securely using the `secrets` module, which supports multiple backends:

- Environment variables
- Files
- Google Secret Manager
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault

```python
from src.config.secrets import get_secret, set_secret

# Get a secret
api_key = get_secret("API_KEY")

# Set a secret
set_secret("NEW_API_KEY", "your-api-key-value")
```

### 1.4 Feature Flags

Feature flags allow for controlled rollout of new features across environments:

```python
from src.config.environment import is_feature_enabled, get_feature_parameters

# Check if a feature is enabled
if is_feature_enabled("advanced_analytics"):
    # Use advanced analytics
    params = get_feature_parameters("advanced_analytics")
    sampling_rate = params.get("sampling_rate", 0.1)
    ...
```

## 2. Environment Promotion Workflow

The environment promotion workflow ensures controlled and validated promotion of code, configuration, and data between environments.

### 2.1 Promotion Process

1. **Development to Staging**:
   - Code is built and tested in development
   - Configuration is validated
   - Promotion creates a snapshot of the development environment
   - Changes are applied to staging
   - Validation tests are run in staging

2. **Staging to Production**:
   - Staging environment is validated
   - Promotion creates a snapshot of the staging environment
   - Changes are applied to production
   - Validation tests are run in production
   - Rollback procedures are available if needed

### 2.2 Using the Promotion System

```python
from src.config.promotion import promote_configuration, rollback_promotion, migrate_data

# Promote configuration from development to staging
success, record = promote_configuration(
    source_env=Environment.DEVELOPMENT,
    target_env=Environment.STAGING,
    components=["feature_flags", "api_config"]
)

# Migrate data between environments
migrate_data(
    source_env=Environment.STAGING,
    target_env=Environment.PRODUCTION,
    data_types=["database", "files"]
)

# Rollback a promotion if needed
rollback_promotion(record.id)
```

### 2.3 Environment Snapshots

The system maintains snapshots of environments before and after promotions, allowing for:

- Historical tracking of environment changes
- Rollback to previous states if needed
- Validation of environment integrity

## 3. Environment Monitoring and Alerting

The monitoring system provides comprehensive visibility into the health and performance of each environment.

### 3.1 Monitoring Components

- **Health dashboards**: Real-time visibility into system health
- **Resource utilization monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Performance monitoring**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Error rate tracking**: Application errors, system errors
- **SLA monitoring**: Uptime, response time, availability
- **Custom alerting rules**: Configurable alerts based on thresholds

### 3.2 Using the Monitoring System

```python
from src.config.monitoring import record_metric, register_alert_rule, start_monitoring

# Record a custom metric
record_metric(
    name="order_processing_time",
    value=1250,  # milliseconds
    labels={"service": "order_service", "endpoint": "/api/orders"}
)

# Register a custom alert rule
register_alert_rule(
    name="high_order_processing_time",
    description="Order processing time is high",
    metric_name="order_processing_time",
    condition=lambda value: value > 2000,  # Alert if > 2 seconds
    severity=AlertSeverity.WARNING
)

# Start monitoring
start_monitoring()
```

### 3.3 Alerting Channels

Alerts can be sent to multiple channels:

- Email
- Slack
- Webhooks
- PagerDuty
- SMS

## 4. Environment Scaling and Optimization

The scaling system provides automatic and manual scaling capabilities to optimize resource usage and performance.

### 4.1 Auto-scaling

The system automatically scales resources based on:

- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Request rate
- Custom metrics

### 4.2 Resource Optimization

The system provides recommendations for resource optimization:

- Right-sizing resources
- Cost optimization
- Performance optimization
- Reliability improvements

### 4.3 Using the Scaling System

```python
from src.config.scaling import start_autoscaling, generate_cost_report, run_load_test

# Start auto-scaling
start_autoscaling()

# Generate a cost report
report = generate_cost_report()

# Run a load test
result = run_load_test(
    name="api_load_test",
    target_rps=100,
    duration=300  # seconds
)
```

## 5. Disaster Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery system provides comprehensive backup, restore, and failover capabilities.

### 5.1 Backup and Restore

The system performs regular backups of:

- Database
- Files
- Configuration

Backups can be restored to any environment for:

- Disaster recovery
- Testing
- Environment replication

### 5.2 Multi-region Failover

The system supports failover between regions:

- Automatic detection of region failures
- Controlled failover process
- Minimal downtime
- Automatic data synchronization

### 5.3 Using the Disaster Recovery System

```python
from src.config.disaster_recovery import create_backup, restore_backup, perform_failover, run_dr_test

# Create a backup
backup = create_backup(
    type=BackupType.FULL,
    components=["database", "files", "configuration"]
)

# Restore a backup
restore = restore_backup(
    backup_id=backup.id,
    target_environment=Environment.STAGING
)

# Perform a failover
failover = perform_failover(
    source_region="us-central1",
    target_region="us-east1"
)

# Run a disaster recovery test
results = run_dr_test()
```

### 5.4 Recovery Time and Point Objectives

The system tracks and reports on:

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): How quickly systems can be restored
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss
