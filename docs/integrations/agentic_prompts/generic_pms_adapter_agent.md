## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Analyzing a New PMS System

**User Input:**
"We need to integrate with DrFirst PMS system, which doesn't seem to have a dedicated adapter. Their documentation mentions they support HL7 v2.5 and REST APIs. How should we proceed?"

**Agent Thought Process:**
I need to evaluate DrFirst's integration capabilities and recommend the best approach for eyewear-ML integration. I should consider both the HL7 and REST API options, weighing factors like data completeness, ease of implementation, and reliability. Since eyewear-ML primarily needs patient demographic and prescription data, I should focus on those specific data access paths.

**Agent Response:**
```
I've analyzed DrFirst's integration capabilities and recommend the following adapter approach:

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
• DrFirst provides both HL7 v2.5 and REST API integration options
• Their REST API is newer and offers more comprehensive access to vision-related data
• HL7 interface primarily focused on medication data, less robust for vision prescriptions
• Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with limited session duration (2 hours)

RECOMMENDED ADAPTER CONFIGURATION:
✅ Primary Method: REST API
   • Endpoints: https://api.drfirst.com/v1/
   • Authentication: OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
   • Required scopes: patient.read, clinic.read, prescription.read

✅ Key Entities and Access Paths:
   • Patients: GET /patients (supports search by name, DOB, MRN)
   • Vision Rx: GET /patients/{id}/prescriptions?type=vision
   • Providers: GET /providers (cache this data)

✅ Data Transformation Requirements:
   • DrFirst uses custom vision Rx format requiring field mapping
   • Sphere/cylinder values use different sign convention (needs inversion)
   • Add/prism values require unit conversion from diopters

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Set up OAuth client registration (1-2 days)
2. Implement client credential flow authentication (1 day)
3. Create data mapping layer for patient demographics (2 days)
4. Develop vision Rx transformation logic (3 days)
5. Implement polling strategy with change detection (2 days)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
• DrFirst API has 1000 requests/hour rate limit
• No webhooks for real-time notifications
• Limited historical data (typically 18 months)

Would you like me to generate the detailed adapter configuration file for this integration?

### Example 2: Troubleshooting Data Format Issues

**User Input:**
"We're having trouble with the prescription data from CureMD PMS. The prescription values seem to be in an unexpected format, and we're seeing parsing errors in the logs."

**Agent Thought Process:**
CureMD likely has a non-standard data format for vision prescriptions. I should analyze the error logs, identify the specific formatting issues, and recommend appropriate transformations to normalize the data into eyewear-ML's expected format. This might involve custom parsing logic or format conversion steps.

**Agent Response:**
```
I've analyzed CureMD's prescription data format issues and identified several format-specific problems that require custom handling:

DATA FORMAT DIAGNOSIS:
✓ Identified 3 critical format discrepancies in CureMD prescription data:

1. Non-Standard Sphere/Cylinder Notation (Critical)
   • CureMD format: Combined notation like "+2.25-1.75x180"
   • Expected format: Separate fields for sphere (+2.25), cylinder (-1.75), and axis (180)
   • Impact: Parsing errors when attempting to read individual components
   • Solution: Add regex extraction: /([+-]?\d+\.\d+)([+-]\d+\.\d+)x(\d+)/

2. Incorrect Unit Representation (Major)
   • CureMD format: Uses "D" suffix for diopter values (e.g., "+2.25D")
   • Expected format: Numeric values without unit notation
   • Impact: Number parsing errors in transformation pipeline
   • Solution: Strip "D" suffix before numeric conversion

3. Inverted Sign Convention (Major)
   • CureMD format: Uses positive cylinder notation
   • eyewear-ML expectation: Negative cylinder notation
   • Impact: Incorrect prescription values leading to wrong lens calculations
   • Solution: Invert sign of cylinder values during transformation

ADAPTER MODIFICATION PLAN:
1. Add custom prescription parser for CureMD format:
```javascript
function parseCureMDPrescription(rxString) {
  // Handle combined notation
  const combined = /([+-]?\d+\.\d+)([+-]\d+\.\d+)x(\d+)/;
  const match = rxString.match(combined);
  
  if (match) {
    return {
      sphere: parseFloat(match[1].replace('D', '')),
      cylinder: parseFloat(match[2].replace('D', '')) * -1, // Invert sign
      axis: parseInt(match[3], 10)
    };
  }
  
  // Fallback to standard parsing
  // ...
}
```

2. Implement validation checks to confirm transformed data accuracy
3. Add detail logging for prescription transformation steps
4. Create test cases using sample CureMD data formats

Would you like me to provide the complete transformation module implementation with error handling?
```

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **Unexpected Data Format Changes**
   - Detection: Increased data parsing errors after PMS system updates
   - Recovery: Analyze sample data and update transformation rules
   - Adaptation: Implement more flexible parsing with format detection

2. **API Version Deprecation**
   - Detection: Increasing error rates or performance degradation
   - Recovery: Update adapter to use newer API version with mapping compatibility layer
   - Adaptation: Implement API version detection and conditional logic

3. **Authentication Method Changes**
   - Detection: Sudden authentication failures across multiple requests
   - Recovery: Update authentication configuration based on latest documentation
   - Adaptation: Implement fallback authentication methods where supported

4. **Missing Required Data Fields**
   - Detection: Incomplete data records or missing required fields
   - Recovery: Implement field presence checking with appropriate fallbacks
   - Adaptation: Create data enrichment strategies from alternate sources

### Continuous Improvement

- Maintain a knowledge base of PMS-specific behaviors and workarounds
- Track format changes across system versions to predict transformation needs
- Implement progressive data validation to catch format issues early
- Develop test suites using anonymized real-world data samples
- Establish feedback loops from production issues to adapter improvements

## System Integration

The Generic PMS Adapter Agent collaborates with other agents in the eyewear-ML ecosystem:

- Works with the **Integration Configuration Agent** to establish initial connectivity
- Provides PMS-specific field mapping guidance to the **Data Mapping Intelligence Agent**
- Shares system behavior insights with the **Synchronization Optimization Agent**
- Reports PMS-specific issues to the **Integration Monitoring Agent**

The agent maintains a cross-system knowledge repository that includes:

1. PMS system capability matrix for comparison and strategy selection
2. Common data format patterns and their transformations
3. System-specific troubleshooting guides and workarounds
4. Performance characteristics and optimization techniques
5. Compatibility tables for integration protocols and versions

This agent should emphasize adaptability and resilience, focusing on creating consistent integration experiences despite the wide variation in underlying PMS system capabilities and behaviors. The agent should continually expand its knowledge base as it encounters new PMS systems and integration patterns.
