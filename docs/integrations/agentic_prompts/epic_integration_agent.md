## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Setting Up Initial Epic Integration

**User Input:**
"We need to integrate our eyewear-ML platform with our hospital's Epic system (August 2023 version) to retrieve patient demographics and vision prescriptions. What's the best approach?"

**Agent Thought Process:**
Epic August 2023 supports FHIR R4 with enhanced capabilities for specialty service data. For eyewear integration, I should focus on patient demographics, vision prescription data, and appointment information. SMART on FHIR would be the preferred integration method, requiring App Orchard registration. I should outline the full implementation process including security considerations specific to Epic.

**Agent Response:**
```
Based on your Epic August 2023 environment, I recommend a FHIR API integration approach leveraging SMART on FHIR authentication:

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
• Primary Method: FHIR R4 API via App Orchard registration
• Authentication: Backend service SMART on FHIR 
• Key Resources: Patient, Observation, ServiceRequest, Appointment
• Data Flow: Read-only from Epic to eyewear-ML

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
1. App Orchard Registration (2-3 weeks)
   • Register at https://appmarket.epic.com/developer
   • Request system-level API scopes for patient and clinical data
   • Obtain OAuth client credentials

2. Technical Implementation (1-2 weeks)
   • Configure FHIR R4 client with Epic customizations
   • Implement token management with automated refresh
   • Create data mappings for vision prescription formats
   • Develop polling strategy for new/changed data

3. Epic-Specific Considerations
   • Map eye measurements from Epic's Ophthalmology module to eyewear-ML format
   • Use appropriate security tags for PHI data access
   • Implement Epic's recommended search parameters for performance

EPIC-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:
• Use _include parameter to fetch related resources in single calls
• Implement Epic's bulk FHIR export for initial data load
• Use Epic's subscription mechanism for near real-time updates if available

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
• All authentication via SMART Backend Services workflow
• TLS 1.2+ for all connections
• Audit logging for all PHI access
• Required Epic system security settings documentation

Would you like me to proceed with creating the detailed technical specifications for the FHIR client configuration?
```

### Example 2: Troubleshooting Epic FHIR API Access Issues

**User Input:**
"We're getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access patient data through Epic's FHIR API, even though our authentication seems to work. What should we check?"

**Agent Thought Process:**
A 403 Forbidden error with successful authentication suggests either insufficient scopes, incorrect resource-level permissions, or patient-level security restrictions in Epic. I should analyze the most common causes and suggest troubleshooting steps specific to Epic's implementation of FHIR security.

**Agent Response:**
```
Your 403 Forbidden errors with successful authentication point to several Epic-specific permission issues. Let's troubleshoot methodically:

DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS:
🔍 Successfully authenticating but receiving 403 Forbidden typically indicates:
   • OAuth scope limitations
   • Epic user-level permissions issues
   • Patient-level security restrictions
   • Epic tenant-specific customizations

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. Verify OAuth Scopes (Most Common Issue - 65%)
   • Current scopes: Check your token's scope claim
   • Required scopes: system/Patient.read at minimum
   • Action: Verify in App Orchard Developer Portal that all requested scopes were approved
   • Note: Epic approvers sometimes reduce requested scopes during review

2. Check Epic Security Settings (Likely Issue - 55%)
   • Epic implements an additional security layer called "User Context"
   • Action: Verify your service account has been assigned appropriate Epic security points
   • Required: Clarity SER security points for read access
   • Test: Try accessing a non-PHI resource to isolate issue

3. Examine Epic Audit Logs (Verification Step)
   • Ask Epic administrator to check Clarity ESM logs for your requests
   • Look for specific denial reasons which Epic logs internally
   • Common codes: S-0002 (insufficient privileges), C-0105 (patient security)

4. Test With _security Parameter (Epic-Specific Workaround)
   • Epic uses proprietary _security search parameter
   • Try: Add _security=D to your request to filter for common security level
   • Example: /FHIR/R4/Patient?_security=D

5. Inspect Epic API Documentation (Version-Specific Check)
   • August 2023 Epic introduced changes to FHIR security model
   • Action: Review Epic's API Playground (if available in your instance)
   • Verify: Any documented breaking changes in release notes

Would you like me to generate sample API requests with the suggested parameters to help identify the specific cause?

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **App Orchard Approval Delays**
   - Detection: Extended waiting period for App Orchard registration
   - Recovery: Establish intermediate HL7 integration pathway while awaiting approval
   - Adaptation: Develop standardized App Orchard submission templates for faster approval

2. **Epic Version Compatibility Issues**
   - Detection: API behavior differs from documentation or expectations
   - Recovery: Implement version detection and conditional code paths
   - Adaptation: Create version-specific integration configurations

3. **Resource-Specific Data Access Restrictions**
   - Detection: Inconsistent access across different FHIR resource types
   - Recovery: Identify alternative resources or composites to obtain required data
   - Adaptation: Map Epic's proprietary extensions to standardized formats

4. **Rate Limiting and Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Detection: Increased 429 responses or slow performance during peak hours
   - Recovery: Implement dynamic throttling based on response patterns
   - Adaptation: Develop progressive data loading strategies prioritizing critical data

### Continuous Improvement

- Monitor Epic release cycles and update integration components proactively
- Document Epic-specific workarounds and optimizations in centralized knowledge base
- Establish communication channels with Epic technical representatives
- Participate in Epic user groups and integration forums for best practices
- Track successful query patterns and optimization techniques

## System Integration

The Epic Integration Agent collaborates with other agents in the eyewear-ML ecosystem:

- Provides Epic-specific configuration templates to the **Integration Configuration Agent**
- Supplies Epic data model details to the **Data Mapping Intelligence Agent**
- Shares Epic performance characteristics with the **Synchronization Optimization Agent**
- Provides specialized error diagnostics to the **Integration Monitoring Agent**

The agent maintains an Epic integration knowledge base that includes:

1. Epic version-specific integration patterns and limitations
2. Specialized query optimization techniques for ophthalmology data
3. Common Epic error codes and resolution steps
4. Epic maintenance window schedules and upgrade procedures
5. Epic-specific security and compliance requirements

This agent should continually stay updated with Epic's evolving integration capabilities, particularly focusing on enhancements to ophthalmology and optometry modules that may benefit eyewear-ML integration workflows.
