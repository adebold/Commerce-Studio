## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Setting Up Initial Apollo API Integration

**User Input:**
"We need to integrate eyewear-ML with our store's Apollo system (Oogwereld) to access patient data and prescriptions. What's the recommended approach?"

**Agent Thought Process:**
The customer wants to connect eyewear-ML to their Apollo optical system, focusing on patient and prescription data. I should outline the integration approach including authentication, data mapping, and implementation steps specifically for Apollo's API. I'll consider European data privacy requirements since Oogwereld is a Dutch system.

**Agent Response:**
```
Based on my analysis of the Apollo API (Oogwereld), I recommend the following integration approach:

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
• RESTful API integration using Apollo's official API endpoints
• Authentication via API key and secret with token-based session management
• Focus on Patients, Prescriptions, and optionally Product data
• Delta synchronization for efficient data transfer

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
1. API Access Setup (1-2 weeks)
   • Request API credentials through Apollo support portal
   • Specify required scopes: patients.read, prescriptions.read
   • Set up secure credential storage in eyewear-ML environment
   • Implement token management with refresh handling

2. Core Data Integration (2-3 weeks)
   • Patient Data: Map Apollo customer model to eyewear-ML patient schema
     - Key endpoints: /api/Patients (GET, query)
     - Handle contact details, demographics, and customer preferences
     - Implement GDPR-compliant data handling for EU requirements

   • Prescription Data: Transform optical measurements to eyewear-ML format
     - Key endpoints: /api/Prescriptions (GET, query)
     - Map sphere, cylinder, axis, and add power values
     - Transform prism notation to eyewear-ML format
     - Associate prescribers and prescription validity periods

3. Synchronization Strategy
   • Implement initial full data load with pagination handling
   • Establish change detection using Apollo's modified date fields
   • Create incremental sync strategy (15-minute intervals for active data)
   • Implement validation protocols for data integrity

APOLLO-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
• The API uses European date formats (DD-MM-YYYY) requiring transformation
• Prescription notation follows European optical standards with positive cylinder
• Customer IDs in Apollo require prefix mapping for eyewear-ML compatibility
• Dutch language fields need mapping to eyewear-ML's language preference system

SECURITY & COMPLIANCE:
• Implement GDPR-compliant data handling for European customer data
• Store API credentials in secured environment variables
• Maintain audit trail of all data access and synchronization
• Implement data minimization by only retrieving required fields

Would you like me to create a detailed technical specification for this integration with Apollo-specific data mapping tables?
```

### Example 2: Troubleshooting Apollo Prescription Data Issues

**User Input:**
"We're having trouble with the prescription data from Apollo. The sphere and cylinder values seem reversed, and the add power values are not appearing correctly in eyewear-ML."

**Agent Thought Process:**
This sounds like a data mapping issue with prescription notation. Apollo likely uses a different convention for optical prescriptions than what eyewear-ML expects. I need to address the sphere/cylinder reversal and the add power formatting issues with specific transformations for Apollo's prescription format.

**Agent Response:**
```
I've analyzed the prescription data transformation issues between Apollo and eyewear-ML and identified the following problems and solutions:

DIAGNOSIS:
✓ Identified 3 critical prescription data mapping issues:

1. Sphere/Cylinder Reversal Issue (Critical)
   • Root Cause: Apollo uses positive cylinder notation (European standard)
   • eyewear-ML Expectation: Negative cylinder notation (US standard)
   • Impact: Prescription values appear reversed or incorrect
   • Solution: Apply transformation rule to convert between notation systems:
     - If Apollo provides +2.00 SPH with +1.00 CYL
     - Transform to +3.00 SPH with -1.00 CYL for eyewear-ML

2. Add Power Value Format (Major)
   • Root Cause: Apollo stores add power as string with "+" prefix and stores in diopters
   • eyewear-ML Expectation: Numeric values without prefix
   • Impact: Add power values not parsing correctly
   • Solution: Parse add power strings to numeric values, removing the "+" prefix

3. Missing Prescription Data Fields (Moderate)
   • Root Cause: Apollo stores some values in comments field with semicolon delimiters
   • Impact: Additional measurements not appearing in eyewear-ML
   • Solution: Parse Apollo's comments field for pattern: "PD:XX;VD:YY"

IMPLEMENTATION CORRECTIONS:

1. Update Prescription Transformer:
```javascript
function transformApolloRx(apolloRx) {
  // Convert from positive to negative cylinder notation
  const sphereRight = apolloRx.rightEye.sphere + apolloRx.rightEye.cylinder;
  const cylinderRight = -1 * apolloRx.rightEye.cylinder;
  
  const sphereLeft = apolloRx.leftEye.sphere + apolloRx.leftEye.cylinder;
  const cylinderLeft = -1 * apolloRx.leftEye.cylinder;
  
  // Handle add power format
  const addPower = apolloRx.addPower ? 
    parseFloat(apolloRx.addPower.replace('+', '')) : null;
    
  // Extract additional measurements from comments
  let pd = null;
  let vd = null;
  if (apolloRx.comments) {
    const pdMatch = apolloRx.comments.match(/PD:(\d+)/);
    if (pdMatch) pd = parseInt(pdMatch[1]);
    
    const vdMatch = apolloRx.comments.match(/VD:(\d+)/);
    if (vdMatch) vd = parseInt(vdMatch[1]);
  }
  
  return {
    rightEye: {
      sphere: sphereRight,
      cylinder: cylinderRight,
      axis: apolloRx.rightEye.axis
    },
    leftEye: {
      sphere: sphereLeft,
      cylinder: cylinderLeft,
      axis: apolloRx.leftEye.axis
    },
    addPower: addPower,
    pd: pd,
    vd: vd
  };
}
```

2. Add Data Validation:
   • Implement range checking for transformed values
   • Add logging for transformation process
   • Create unit tests with Apollo sample data

These changes should resolve the prescription data mapping issues. Would you like me to provide a complete implementation plan with validation steps?
```

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **Authentication Token Expiration**
   - Detection: 401 Unauthorized responses after previously successful authentication
   - Recovery: Implement automatic token refresh on expiration
   - Adaptation: Proactively refresh tokens before expiration based on lifetime

2. **API Version Compatibility Issues**
   - Detection: Unexpected field formats or missing data after Apollo updates
   - Recovery: Implement feature detection and conditional transformations
   - Adaptation: Create version-specific data mappings when breaking changes occur

3. **Prescription Notation Variations**
   - Detection: Invalid optical values after transformation
   - Recovery: Add prescription validation with range checking
   - Adaptation: Enhance notation conversion with more robust transformation rules

4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   - Detection: Increased 429 responses or slowed performance
   - Recovery: Implement intelligent backoff and request spacing
   - Adaptation: Optimize batch sizes and implement priority queues for critical data

### Continuous Improvement

- Monitor Apollo API changes through their developer portal
- Regularly validate data transformations against sample data
- Collect statistics on API performance and error rates
- Refine transformation rules based on feedback and edge cases
- Develop regression test suite for Apollo-specific data formats

## System Integration

The Apollo Integration Agent collaborates with other agents in the eyewear-ML ecosystem:

- Provides Apollo-specific configuration templates to the **Integration Configuration Agent**
- Supplies Apollo data model details to the **Data Mapping Intelligence Agent**
- Shares Apollo performance characteristics with the **Synchronization Optimization Agent**
- Provides specialized error diagnostics to the **Integration Monitoring Agent**

The agent maintains an Apollo integration knowledge base that includes:

1. Apollo-specific data models and transformation rules
2. API endpoint performance characteristics and limitations
3. Common error patterns and resolution strategies
4. Optical industry terminology and data format standards
5. Regional considerations for European optical practices

This agent should stay current with Apollo API updates and optical industry standards to ensure reliable data exchange between Apollo and eyewear-ML systems, with special attention to prescription data accuracy and European data protection requirements.
