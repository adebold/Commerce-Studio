# E-commerce Integration User Journeys and Testing Strategy

This document outlines the user journeys and testing strategy for Eyewear ML's e-commerce integrations, focusing on the component-based architecture and how merchants interact with the platform.

## Component-Based Architecture Overview

Eyewear ML is designed as a modular platform with a plugin-like architecture, similar to WordPress plugins or the Apple App Store model. This design allows retailers to selectively integrate specific components based on their needs.

### Core Platform and Extension Model

1. **Core Platform**: 
   - Base functionality for eyewear management and ML capabilities
   - API infrastructure for third-party integration
   - Authentication and security framework
   - Data storage and synchronization services

2. **App Extensions**:
   - Independently deployable modules
   - Configurable through the merchant dashboard
   - Standard API interfaces for platform communication
   - Isolated functionality with defined dependencies

3. **Integration Types**:
   - **Embedded Modules**: Direct integration of Eyewear ML components into e-commerce platforms
   - **API-Based Integration**: Data exchange between systems through RESTful APIs
   - **Third-Party Provider Connections**: API key integration with external services

4. **Data Flow**:
   - Real-time synchronization between Eyewear ML and e-commerce platforms
   - Event-driven architecture for change propagation
   - Batch processing for historical data migration
   - Cache-based performance optimization
