# Modules Documentation

This directory contains documentation for various modules and components that are part of the eyewear-ml platform. Each module has its own documentation file that describes its architecture, integration points, and implementation details.

## Purpose

The modules documentation serves as a reference for developers, architects, and other stakeholders to understand:

1. How different modules are designed
2. How modules integrate with the main application
3. Implementation details and technical specifications
4. Integration plans and roadmaps

## Available Module Documentation

- [SKU-Genie Authentication Integration Plan](./SKU-Genie-Auth-Integration-Plan.md) - Details how the SKU-Genie module integrates with the main application's authentication and RBAC system.

## Adding New Module Documentation

When adding a new module to the platform, please create corresponding documentation in this directory. The documentation should include:

1. Overview of the module's purpose
2. Architecture and design decisions
3. Integration points with the main application
4. Implementation details
5. Usage examples
6. Testing approach

## Best Practices

- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Include diagrams where appropriate (using Mermaid or other diagram formats)
- Keep documentation up-to-date as modules evolve
- Cross-reference related documentation
- Include code examples where helpful
