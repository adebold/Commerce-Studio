# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Integration

This document explains the Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) integration in our CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing methodology that analyzes running applications for vulnerabilities that might not be detectable through static code analysis. Unlike static analysis, DAST can identify runtime issues, authentication problems, server configuration issues, and other security vulnerabilities that only manifest when the application is running.

Our DAST implementation uses [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) (Zed Attack Proxy), a widely-used open-source security testing tool.

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

The DAST scan is automatically triggered after each successful deployment to any environment (development, staging, or production). This ensures that security testing is performed on the actual deployed application.

### Workflow

1. After a successful deployment in the CD pipeline, a DAST scan is triggered via a repository dispatch event
2. The DAST workflow runs a ZAP baseline scan against the deployed application
3. Scan results are saved as artifacts and processed to generate a summary
4. If high or critical security issues are found, a notification is sent to the team

### Manual Triggering

You can also manually trigger a DAST scan through the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the repository
2. Select the "Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the environment and optionally specify a custom target URL
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Scan Configuration

The DAST scan is configured to run a baseline scan, which is a passive scan that doesn't perform any active attacks against the application. This makes it safe to run against production environments.

### Customizing the Scan

The scan configuration is defined in the `.github/zap-rules.tsv` file. This file specifies which alerts to ignore to reduce false positives. You can modify this file to customize the scan behavior.

Current ignored alerts:
- Form autocomplete attribute missing (10016)
- Information disclosure - suspicious comments (10027)
- Non-storable content (10049)
- Cookie without SameSite attribute (10054)
- CSP scanner (10055)
- Timestamp disclosure (10096)
- Modern web application (10109)

To modify the scan configuration:

1. Edit the `.github/zap-rules.tsv` file
2. Add or remove rules in the format: `[rule ID]\t[IGNORE/WARN/FAIL]\t# [Description]`
3. Commit and push the changes

## Interpreting Scan Results

After each scan, the results are available as artifacts in the GitHub Actions run:

1. HTML report: Provides a detailed view of all findings with explanations and remediation advice
2. JSON report: Machine-readable format for integration with other tools
3. Summary markdown file: Quick overview of the scan results

### Risk Levels

ZAP categorizes findings by risk level:

- **High**: Serious vulnerabilities that should be addressed immediately
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that should be addressed in the near term
- **Low**: Minor issues that should be addressed when possible
- **Informational**: Findings that don't represent a security risk but might be useful to know

## Handling Security Issues

When security issues are found:

1. **High and Critical Issues**: Address immediately. These often represent serious vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other significant security incidents.

2. **Medium Issues**: Create tickets to address these issues in the next sprint or release cycle.

3. **Low and Informational Issues**: Document these issues and address them as part of regular maintenance.

### Common Remediation Steps

For common issues found by DAST scans:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Implement proper output encoding and input validation
- **Injection Flaws**: Use parameterized queries and input validation
- **Authentication Issues**: Review and strengthen authentication mechanisms
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Update server configurations and security headers
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Encrypt sensitive data and review data handling practices

## Integration with Security Processes

The DAST scan results should be integrated into the broader security processes:

1. **Security Review**: Include DAST findings in regular security reviews
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use DAST findings to inform risk assessments
3. **Compliance**: Document DAST scans and remediation efforts for compliance purposes
4. **Security Training**: Use DAST findings to identify areas for developer security training

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to the DAST integration:

1. **Full Scan Option**: Add the ability to run a full active scan in non-production environments
2. **API Scanning**: Add specific API scanning capabilities
3. **Authentication Support**: Add support for authenticated scans
4. **Custom Rules**: Develop custom ZAP rules for application-specific vulnerabilities
5. **Trend Analysis**: Track security issues over time to identify patterns
