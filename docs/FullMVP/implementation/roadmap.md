# Implementation Roadmap for EyewearML Full MVP

This document outlines the step-by-step roadmap for implementing the EyewearML Hybrid AI Shopping Platform MVP. It provides a comprehensive guide for completing the integration between MongoDB, generating the HTML and Shopify stores, and implementing the AI assistant.

## Overview

The implementation process is divided into four main phases:

## Implementation Details

### Database Implementation

The MongoDB implementation should follow the schema defined in [Database Schema](../architecture/database_schema.md) and include:

```javascript
// Example implementation of product repository
class ProductRepository {
  constructor(db) {
    this.collection = db.collection('products');
  }
  
  async findById(id) {
    return this.collection.findOne({ id });
  }
  
  async findByFaceShape(faceShape, options = {}) {
    const { limit = 10, sort = { "reviews.average_rating": -1 } } = options;
    
    return this.collection
      .find({ recommended_face_shapes: faceShape })
      .sort(sort)
      .limit(limit)
      .toArray();
  }
  
  // Additional methods as needed
}
```

### HTML Store Implementation

The HTML store generator should create static files structured as follows:

```
apps/html-store/
  ├── index.html
  ├── css/
  │   ├── styles.css
  │   └── responsive.css
  ├── js/
  │   ├── search.js
  │   ├── filters.js
  │   └── ai-assistant.js
  ├── products/
  │   ├── product-1.html
  │   ├── product-2.html
  │   └── ...
  ├── categories/
  │   ├── sunglasses.html
  │   ├── eyeglasses.html
  │   └── ...
  ├── images/
  │   ├── products/
  │   └── ui/
  └── data/
      └── products.json
```

### Shopify Integration Implementation

The Shopify connector should handle product synchronization:

```javascript
// Example Shopify synchronization function
async function synchronizeProducts(db, shopifyClient) {
  const products = await db.collection('products')
    .find({ "metadata.validation_status": "validated" })
    .toArray();
    
  console.log(`Synchronizing ${products.length} products to Shopify`);
  
  for (const product of products) {
    try {
      // Check if product exists in Shopify
      const shopifyProductId = product.shopify?.product_id;
      
      if (shopifyProductId) {
        // Update existing product
        await updateShopifyProduct(shopifyClient, shopifyProductId, product);
        console.log(`Updated product: ${product.name}`);
      } else {
        // Create new product
        const newShopifyProduct = await createShopifyProduct(shopifyClient, product);
        
        // Store Shopify ID back in MongoDB
        await db.collection('products').updateOne(
          { id: product.id },
          { 
            $set: { 
              "shopify.product_id": newShopifyProduct.id,
              "shopify.handle": newShopifyProduct.handle
            }
          }
        );
        
        console.log(`Created product: ${product.name}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error synchronizing product ${product.id}:`, error);
    }
  }
  
  console.log('Shopify synchronization complete');
}
```

### AI Assistant Implementation

The AI assistant integration should follow this pattern:

```javascript
// Example AI assistant service
class AssistantService {
  constructor(db, vertexAI) {
    this.productRepository = new ProductRepository(db);
    this.assistantLogRepository = new BaseRepository(db, 'aiAssistantLogs');
    this.vertexAI = vertexAI;
  }
  
  async processQuery(query, storeType, sessionId = null) {
    try {
      console.log(`Processing query: "${query}" for store type: ${storeType}`);
      
      // Extract keywords for product search
      const keywords = this.extractKeywords(query);
      
      // Get relevant products
      const relevantProducts = await this.productRepository.searchByKeywords(keywords);
      console.log(`Found ${relevantProducts.length} relevant products`);
      
      // Prepare context for AI
      const context = {
        storeType,
        products: relevantProducts,
        sessionId
      };
      
      // Get AI response
      const aiResponse = await this.callVertexAI(query, context);
      
      // Process response to extract recommendations
      const processedResponse = this.processAIResponse(
        aiResponse, 
        relevantProducts
      );
      
      // Log interaction
      await this.logInteraction(query, processedResponse, context);
      
      return processedResponse;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing assistant query:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  // Helper methods would be implemented here
}
```
