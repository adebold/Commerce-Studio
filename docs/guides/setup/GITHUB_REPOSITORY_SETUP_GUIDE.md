   - Visibility: Choose Public or Private

   ```

   ```

### Option 2: Check Existing Repository

   ```bash
   # Set up credential helper
   git config --global credential.helper store
   
   # Update remote URL with token
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/adebold/Commerce-Studio.git
   ```

2. **Using SSH (Alternative):**
