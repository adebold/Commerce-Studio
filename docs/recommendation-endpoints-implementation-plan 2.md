# Recommendation Endpoints Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the recommendation endpoints for the Eyewear Recommendation API.

## Goal

To create API endpoints for personalized, popular, and trending recommendations that are well-defined, robust, and easy to use.

## Steps

1.  **Define Request and Response Models:**
    *   Create Pydantic models for the request and response data of each recommendation endpoint.
    *   Define the input parameters (e.g., user ID, product ID, category) for each endpoint.
    *   Define the output fields (e.g., list of recommended products, scores, metadata) for each endpoint.
    *   Ensure that the models are well-documented and that they include appropriate validation rules.

2.  **Implement Route Handlers:**
    *   Create the route handlers for each recommendation endpoint in the `src/api/routers/recommendations.py` file.
    *   Define the API routes (e.g., `/recommendations/personalized`, `/recommendations/popular`, `/recommendations/trending`) for each endpoint.
    *   Implement the logic to retrieve recommendations from the recommendation service.
    *   Format the response data according to the defined response models.
    *   Implement appropriate error handling and logging.

3.  **Integrate with Recommendation Service:**
    *   Integrate the route handlers with the recommendation service.
    *   Call the appropriate functions in the recommendation service to retrieve recommendations based on the input parameters.
    *   Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the integration.
    *   Ensure that the data is passed correctly between the route handlers and the service.

4.  **Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Implement error handling for each recommendation endpoint.
    *   Handle invalid input parameters.
    *   Handle errors from the recommendation service.
    *   Handle any other exceptions that may occur.
    *   Return appropriate error responses to the client.

5.  **Add API Documentation:**
    *   Add API documentation for each recommendation endpoint using FastAPI's built-in documentation features.
    *   Document the request and response models.
    *   Document the input parameters.
    *   Document the possible errors.
    *   Document any other relevant information.

6.  **Test the Endpoints:**
    *   Write unit tests and integration tests for each recommendation endpoint.
    *   Ensure that the endpoints are working correctly.
    *   Ensure that the endpoints are returning the expected results.
    *   Use pytest for testing.

## Deliverables

*   Pydantic models for request and response data
*   Route handlers for each recommendation endpoint
*   Integration with the recommendation service
*   Error handling for each endpoint
*   API documentation for each endpoint
*   Unit tests and integration tests for each endpoint
