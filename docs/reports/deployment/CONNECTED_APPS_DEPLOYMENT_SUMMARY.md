## üìã Next Steps for GitHub Integration

   git ls-remote origin
   ```

2. **Alternative: Create New Repository**

   - Update remote URL
   - Push feature branch

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Once pushed, create PR from `feature/connected-apps-marketplace` to `main`
   - Include comprehensive description of changes
   - Reference deployment success and testing results
