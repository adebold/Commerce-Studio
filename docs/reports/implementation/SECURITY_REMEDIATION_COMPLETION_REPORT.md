- ‚úÖ **Removed all hardcoded secrets** from `website/.env`
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated insecure fallbacks** in `website/api/stripe/config.js`
- ‚úÖ **Replaced with environment variable placeholders** using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` format
- ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive security comments** explaining the secure approach

### 2. Google Cloud Secret Manager Integration
- ‚úÖ **Created automated setup script**: `scripts/setup-google-cloud-secrets.sh`
- ‚úÖ **Established 18 secure secrets** in Google Cloud Secret Manager:
  - Stripe API keys (publishable, secret, webhook)
  - Stripe product and price IDs (6 products)
  - Token package price IDs (3 packages)
  - Database connection URL
  - JWT authentication secret
  - Email SMTP configuration (5 settings)

### 3. Secure Cloud Run Configuration
- ‚úÖ **Created secure deployment config**: `website/cloud-run-secret-config.yaml`
- ‚úÖ **Implemented secret binding** from Google Cloud Secret Manager
- ‚úÖ **Configured proper IAM permissions** for Cloud Run service access
- ‚úÖ **Added health checks and resource limits** for production deployment

### 4. Enhanced Security Validation
- ‚úÖ **Implemented fail-fast validation** in Stripe configuration
- ‚úÖ **Added secret format validation** to prevent invalid keys
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced error handling** with clear security messages
- ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive logging** for secret validation failures

## üîê Security Infrastructure Implemented

### Google Cloud Secret Manager Setup
```bash
# Automated secret creation with proper labeling
- 18 secrets created with app=varai-commerce-studio labels
- Automatic replication policy for high availability
- Proper IAM permissions for Cloud Run access
```

### Secure Environment Configuration
```env
# Before (CRITICAL VULNERABILITY):
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=rk_live_51OjQqs...

# After (SECURE):
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}
```

### Enhanced Code Security
```javascript
// Before (INSECURE FALLBACKS):
this.stripeSecretKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || 'rk_live_51OjQqs...';

// After (SECURE WITH VALIDATION):
this.stripeSecretKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY;
this.validateSecrets();
```

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

### Secure Cloud Run Deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Retrieved from Google Cloud Secret Manager
- **Secret Binding**: Automatic injection of latest secret versions
- **IAM Security**: Least privilege access with proper service account permissions
- **Health Monitoring**: Liveness and readiness probes for production stability

### Production Security Features
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All sensitive data externalized
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Application refuses to start without proper secrets
- **Format Validation**: Ensures secret keys match expected patterns
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events logged for monitoring

## üìä Security Validation Results

### Code Security Audit
- ‚úÖ **Zero hardcoded secrets** in source code
- ‚úÖ **No insecure fallback values** in configuration
- ‚úÖ **Proper environment variable usage** throughout codebase
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced validation logic** prevents startup with missing secrets

### Infrastructure Security
- ‚úÖ **Google Cloud Secret Manager** properly configured
- ‚úÖ **IAM permissions** follow least privilege principle
- ‚úÖ **Secret versioning** enabled for rotation capability
- ‚úÖ **Automatic replication** for high availability

### Deployment Security
- ‚úÖ **Secure Cloud Run configuration** with secret binding
- ‚úÖ **Production environment variables** properly isolated
- ‚úÖ **Health checks** ensure application stability
- ‚úÖ **Resource limits** prevent resource exhaustion

## üîÑ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Secret Management
- **Externalized Configuration**: All secrets moved to Google Cloud Secret Manager
- **Environment Isolation**: Production secrets isolated from development
- **Version Control Safety**: No secrets committed to repository
- **Rotation Ready**: Infrastructure supports easy secret rotation

### 2. Application Security
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Application validates secrets on startup
- **Format Checking**: Ensures secrets match expected patterns
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing sensitive data
- **Logging**: Security events logged for monitoring and auditing

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Least Privilege**: IAM permissions limited to necessary access
- **Automatic Updates**: Secret Manager provides latest versions automatically
- **High Availability**: Automatic replication across regions
- **Monitoring Ready**: Infrastructure supports security monitoring
