## Total Estimated Duration: 56 working days (approximately 11-12 weeks)

## Assumptions and Notes

1. This timeline assumes:
   - One developer working on each prompt at a time
   - No significant blockers or dependencies outside the project
   - Availability of necessary resources and infrastructure

2. Parallel work:
   - Some prompts could be worked on in parallel with additional developers
   - Backend and frontend work could be parallelized after Phase 2

3. Testing and QA:
   - Each prompt includes time for unit testing
   - Additional time should be allocated for QA and integration testing
   - User acceptance testing should be scheduled after each phase

4. Adjustments:
   - Timeline should be reviewed and adjusted after each phase
   - Additional time may be needed for addressing feedback and refinements
