### How does EyewearML differ from regular e-commerce platforms?

Our platform understands eyewear-specific attributes like frame shapes, face compatibility, and style characteristics to help customers find the perfect glasses for their needs.

EyewearML is designed for:
- **Eyewear retailers** (optical shops, eyewear brands, and e-commerce businesses)

### How does the AI enhancement work?

Our platform uses Google's Vertex AI to analyze your product data and automatically generate enriched metadata such as:

- **Face shape compatibility scores**: AI determines how well each frame works with different face shapes (oval, round, square, heart, diamond, oblong)
- **Style keywords**: AI identifies relevant style attributes like "vintage," "sporty," or "elegant"
- **Feature summaries**: AI creates concise descriptions highlighting key product features
- **Style descriptions**: AI generates detailed style descriptions explaining who the frames would suit best

This enriched data powers more intelligent product discovery and recommendations.

### How accurate are the AI-generated recommendations?

Our AI recommendations are highly accurate thanks to:
1. Training on extensive eyewear expertise and industry standards
2. Analysis of frame attributes, measurements, and design characteristics
3. Continuous improvement based on customer interactions

The system also provides confidence scores for its recommendations, and our hybrid approach ensures a human can review and override any recommendations if needed.
