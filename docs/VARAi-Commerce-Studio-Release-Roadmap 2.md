# VARAi Commerce Studio Release Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for the first release of VARAi Commerce Studio, a comprehensive platform for eyewear retailers. The platform will enable clients to register, set up HTML stores or use a Shopify plugin, and access core features including an onboarding wizard, inventory browsing, plugins (Virtual try-on, PD-calculator), and reporting capabilities.

This roadmap prioritizes the use of Storybook for component development and design consistency. It also acknowledges the existence of the client portal API, the business services, the auth module, and the Shopify app, and adjusts the plan accordingly.

## Technical Architecture

The platform will be built on the existing core architecture, which includes:

1. **API Gateway Layer**: Entry point for all client interactions
2. **Service Infrastructure**: Environment for all platform services
3. **Data Management Layer**: Handles data storage and retrieval
4. **Security Framework**: Ensures protection of platform data
5. **Integration Framework**: Enables connectivity with external systems
6. **Observability Stack**: Provides visibility into platform behavior

The business services, auth module, and Shopify app will be integrated into this architecture.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Integration complexity between components | Implement clear API contracts and comprehensive testing |
| Performance issues with virtual try-on | Implement progressive loading and optimization techniques |
| Data migration challenges during onboarding | Create robust validation and error handling processes |
| Shopify API limitations | Design fallback mechanisms and implement rate limiting handling |
| Security vulnerabilities | Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing |

## Success Criteria

The release will be considered successful when:

1. Clients can register and set up their accounts independently
2. Both HTML store and Shopify plugin options are fully functional
3. The onboarding wizard successfully imports product data
4. Inventory browsing works efficiently with search and filtering
5. Virtual try-on and PD-calculator plugins function correctly
6. Reports provide valuable insights to clients
7. The system meets performance benchmarks under expected load
8. All security requirements are met and validated
