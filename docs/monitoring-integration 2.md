# Deployment Monitoring Integration

This document provides information about the monitoring integration for the deployment process.

## Overview

The deployment monitoring integration allows for real-time tracking of deployments across different environments and provides valuable insights into deployment performance and reliability. It integrates with multiple monitoring systems and can send notifications for deployment events.

## Architecture

The monitoring integration consists of the following components:

1. **Monitoring Module**: A flexible module that integrates with multiple monitoring systems
2. **Deployment Scripts**: Enhanced deployment scripts that send events to monitoring systems
3. **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notification service for alerts (Slack, Teams, SMS, Email, PagerDuty)
4. **Remediation Engine**: Automated remediation for common deployment issues

## Monitoring Systems

The monitoring integration supports the following monitoring systems:

### Datadog

Datadog integration provides:
- Deployment event tracking
- Deployment metrics
- Deployment dashboards
- Deployment alerts

### Prometheus/Grafana

Prometheus/Grafana integration provides:
- Deployment metrics
- Deployment dashboards
- Deployment alerts

## Notification Service

The notification service supports multiple channels to send alerts for deployment events. It includes the following notification channels:

### Firebase Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send email alerts for deployment events.

### Slack

Slack integration sends formatted notifications to Slack channels with detailed deployment information.

### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams integration sends formatted notifications to Teams channels with detailed deployment information.

### SMS (Twilio)

SMS integration sends text message alerts for critical deployment events using Twilio.

### PagerDuty

PagerDuty integration creates incidents for critical deployment issues with appropriate severity levels.

The notification service supports the following notification types:

- Deployment started
- Deployment completed
- Deployment failed
- Rollback initiated
- Rollback completed
- Canary deployment started
- Canary deployment completed
- Canary promotion completed

### Role-Based Notification Routing

The notification service supports role-based routing to send notifications to different roles based on event type:

- **Ops Team**: Receives critical alerts (failures, rollbacks) on all channels
- **Dev Team**: Receives all deployment events on Slack

## Usage

### Command-Line Options

The deployment scripts support the following command-line options for monitoring:

```bash
# Enable all features (default)
python deploy_with_rollback.py --environment staging

# Disable monitoring
python deploy_with_rollback.py --environment staging --disable-monitoring

# Disable notifications
python deploy_with_rollback.py --environment staging --disable-notifications

# Disable automated remediation
python deploy_with_rollback.py --environment staging --disable-remediation
```

### Configuration

The monitoring integration can be configured using a configuration file. The configuration file can be in JSON or YAML format.

Example configuration file:

```yaml

    events: ["failure", "rollback"]
  dev:
    channels: ["slack"]
    events: ["status", "failure", "rollback", "canary", "promotion"]
```

## Deployment Events

The monitoring integration tracks the following deployment events:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `status` | General deployment status update |
| `failure` | Deployment failure |
| `rollback` | Deployment rollback |
| `canary` | Canary deployment |
| `promotion` | Canary promotion |

## Dashboards

The monitoring integration creates the following dashboards:

### Deployment Metrics Dashboard

The Deployment Metrics Dashboard provides an overview of deployment metrics, including:

- Deployment success rate
- Deployment duration
- Deployments by status
- Deployments by environment
- Deployments by type

### Deployment Alerts Dashboard

The Deployment Alerts Dashboard provides an overview of deployment alerts, including:

- Recent deployment failures
- Long-running deployments
- Failed rollbacks
- Canary deployment issues

## Alerts

The monitoring integration creates the following alerts:

| Alert | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Deployment Failure | Alert when a deployment fails | Critical |
| Long-Running Deployment | Alert when a deployment takes longer than expected | Warning |
| Failed Rollback | Alert when a rollback fails | Critical |
| Canary Deployment Issue | Alert when a canary deployment has issues | Warning |

## Firebase Notification Integration

The Firebase notification integration uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to send email alerts for deployment events. It requires the following setup:

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging
3. Create a service account with permissions to send messages
4. Configure the notification service with the service account credentials

### Email Alert Templates

The notification service uses the following email alert templates:

| Event Type | Subject | Content |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Deployment Started | `[${environment}] Deployment Started` | Deployment ID, environment, components |
| Deployment Completed | `[${environment}] Deployment Completed` | Deployment ID, environment, components, duration |
| Deployment Failed | `[${environment}] Deployment Failed` | Deployment ID, environment, components, error |
| Rollback Initiated | `[${environment}] Rollback Initiated` | Deployment ID, environment, components |
| Rollback Completed | `[${environment}] Rollback Completed` | Deployment ID, environment, components, duration |

## Implementation Details

### Monitoring Module

The monitoring module (`deployment_monitoring.py`) provides a flexible interface for integrating with multiple monitoring systems. It uses a plugin architecture to support different monitoring systems.

```python
# Initialize monitoring
monitoring = DeploymentMonitoring()

# Send deployment event
monitoring.send_deployment_event("status", deployment_record)
```

### Deployment Scripts

The deployment scripts (`deploy_with_rollback.py`) integrate with the monitoring module to send events for different deployment operations.

```python
# Deploy with monitoring
success, record = deploy(args.environment, args.type, 
                         simulate_failure=args.simulate_failure, 
                         monitoring=monitoring)
```

### Notification Service

The notification service supports multiple notification channels for deployment events.

```python
# Initialize notification manager
notification_manager = NotificationManager()

# Send notification to all channels for specified roles
notification_manager.send_notification("status", deployment_record, ["ops", "dev"])

# Send notification to specific channels
notification_manager.send_notification("failure", deployment_record, ["ops"])
```

## Automated Remediation

The automated remediation system can automatically address common deployment issues without manual intervention. It includes the following remediation actions:

### Pod Restart

Automatically restarts pods that are in a crash loop or pending state.

### Deployment Restart

Restarts deployments that are stuck or unavailable.

### Deployment Scaling

Automatically scales deployments to handle resource constraints.

### Configuration

The remediation system can be configured with the following parameters:

- **enabled**: Enable or disable automated remediation
- **auto_remediate**: Automatically remediate issues without manual intervention
- **max_attempts**: Maximum number of remediation attempts
- **cooldown_period**: Cooldown period between remediation attempts (in seconds)

### Usage

```python
# Initialize remediation engine
remediation = RemediationEngine()

# Remediate an issue
remediation.remediate("pod_crash", {
    "namespace": "varai-staging",
    "pod_name": "api-123456-abcde",
    "environment": "staging"
})
```

## Next Steps

To further enhance the deployment monitoring:

1. **Integration with CI/CD Pipeline**: Connect monitoring to CI/CD systems for end-to-end visibility
2. **Advanced Metrics**: Add more detailed performance metrics during deployments
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Create role-specific dashboards for different stakeholders
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement ML-based anomaly detection for deployment patterns
5. **Extended Notification Channels**: Add support for additional notification channels
