# Preference Extraction System - Agentic Development Prompts

This document contains agentic prompts for implementing the Preference Extraction system for our conversational AI engine. Each prompt represents a specific development task that can be implemented independently.

## Implementation Approach

The preference extraction system will be developed in the following stages:

1. Preference taxonomy and data model
2. Direct preference extraction (explicit statements)
3. Inferential preference extraction (implicit cues)
4. Preference consolidation and conflict resolution
5. Integration with product catalog and recommendation system

## Prompt 1: Preference Taxonomy and Data Model

**Task:** Design a comprehensive taxonomy of eyewear preferences and implement the core data model for the preference extraction system.

**Context:** The system needs to identify, store, and reason about customer preferences across multiple dimensions including style, fit, functionality, and budget.

**Requirements:**
- Design a hierarchical taxonomy of eyewear-specific preferences
- Create a comprehensive data model for representing preferences
- Implement preference storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Design confidence scoring for preference certainty
- Create preference metadata tracking (source, timestamp, etc.)

**Implementation Details:**
- Include preference categories for style, fit, function, budget, and meta-preferences
- Design for both structured (categorical) and unstructured (free-text) preferences
- Implement proper normalization of preference values
- Create scoring mechanisms for preference strength/confidence
- Design for efficient querying and filtering of preferences

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Preference taxonomy documentation
- Preference data model implementation
- Storage and retrieval utilities
- Example preference profiles
- Unit tests for core functionality

- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/models.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/test_models.py`

## Prompt 2: Direct Preference Extraction

**Task:** Implement a system for extracting explicitly stated preferences from customer messages.

**Context:** Customers often directly express their preferences in conversations (e.g., "I prefer round frames" or "I'm looking for something lightweight"). The system needs to reliably identify and extract these explicit statements.

**Requirements:**
- Design pattern-based and ML-based extraction methods
- Create comprehensive pattern libraries for common preference expressions
- Implement confidence scoring for extracted preferences
- Develop entity linking to standardized preference values
- Create negation handling for negative preferences

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement regex and keyword-based pattern matching
- Create context-aware pattern validators
- Use NLP techniques for structured information extraction
- Design for multilingual support where feasible
- Create extensible pattern libraries for different preference types

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Direct extraction implementation
- Pattern libraries for different preference categories
- Entity normalization utilities
- Extraction evaluation metrics
- Documentation and examples

- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/patterns/`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/test_direct_extraction.py`

## Prompt 3: Inferential Preference Extraction

**Task:** Develop a system for inferring implicit preferences from conversational cues and customer behavior.

**Context:** Beyond explicit statements, customers reveal preferences implicitly through comparisons, reactions to suggestions, questions, and general conversation. The system should be able to extract these implicit preferences.

**Requirements:**
- Design inference mechanisms for implicit preference detection
- Implement sentiment analysis for preference inference
- Create methods for extracting preferences from reactions and comparisons
- Develop preference inference from question patterns
- Implement confidence scoring for inferred preferences

**Implementation Details:**
- Use sentiment analysis for positive/negative reactions
- Create comparative statement analysis
- Implement question analysis for preference inference
- Design attention analysis (what customers focus on)
- Create behavioral signal processing

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Inferential extraction implementation
- Sentiment analysis module
- Comparison and reaction analyzers
- Question analysis module
- Documentation and evaluation metrics

**Related Files:**
- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/inferential_extraction.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/sentiment_analysis.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/test_inferential_extraction.py`

## Prompt 4: Interactive Preference Elicitation

**Task:** Implement a system for actively eliciting preferences through strategic conversation.

**Context:** Sometimes the most effective way to understand customer preferences is to ask targeted questions. The system should be able to identify when to ask preference-clarifying questions and generate appropriate queries.

**Requirements:**
- Design an interactive preference elicitation strategy
- Implement preference gap identification
- Create context-appropriate question generation
- Develop question prioritization algorithms
- Implement response processing for elicited preferences

**Implementation Details:**
- Create preference coverage analysis
- Implement question templates for different preference dimensions
- Design for naturalistic conversation flow
- Create adaptive questioning based on previous responses
- Implement multi-turn elicitation strategies

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Interactive elicitation implementation
- Question generation module
- Response processing utilities
- Conversation flow integrations
- Documentation and example dialogues

- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/interactive_elicitation.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/question_generation.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/test_interactive_elicitation.py`

## Prompt 5: Preference Consolidation and Conflict Resolution

**Task:** Develop a system for consolidating preferences and resolving conflicts in preference data.

**Context:** Customer preferences may evolve during a conversation, contradict each other, or have varying degrees of certainty. The system needs mechanisms to maintain a coherent preference profile.

**Requirements:**
- Design a preference consolidation system
- Implement conflict detection for contradictory preferences
- Create resolution strategies for preference conflicts
- Develop preference strength and recency weighting
- Implement preference update mechanisms

**Implementation Details:**
- Create multi-strategy conflict resolution
- Implement preference confidence scoring
- Design temporal weighting mechanisms
- Create preference relationship analysis
- Implement explanatory capabilities for resolution decisions

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Preference consolidation implementation
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Resolution strategy implementations
- Preference profile management
- Unit tests and documentation

**Related Files:**
- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/consolidation.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/conflict_resolution.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/preference_extraction/test_consolidation.py`

## Prompt 6: Catalog Integration and Preference-Based Matching

**Task:** Implement a system for mapping extracted preferences to product attributes and enabling preference-based product matching.

**Context:** Extracted preferences need to be translated into actionable product recommendations by matching them to our product catalog attributes.

**Requirements:**
- Design preference-to-catalog attribute mapping
- Implement preference-based product scoring and ranking
- Create explanation generation for preference matches
- Develop gap analysis between preferences and available products
- Implement partial matching for imperfect fits

**Implementation Details:**
- Create bidirectional mappings between preference taxonomy and catalog attributes
- Implement weighted matching algorithms
- Design for handling incomplete preference information
- Create preference-based filters and sorts
- Implement explanation generation for recommendations

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Catalog integration implementation
- Preference matching algorithms
- Explanation generation utilities
- Integration tests with product catalog
- Documentation and example use cases
