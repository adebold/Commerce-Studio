# Contextual Memory System

## Overview

The Contextual Memory system enables our conversational AI to maintain a coherent understanding of customer needs throughout an interaction. By remembering earlier parts of the conversation, tracking preferences, and building a comprehensive customer profile, the system provides personalized responses that feel like a continuous, natural dialogue rather than disconnected exchanges.

## Types of Memory

Our contextual memory system maintains several types of memory:

### 1. Short-term Conversation Memory

Short-term memory stores the immediate conversation history, typically spanning the current session.

**Contents:**
- Recent messages (user and system)
- Current conversation flow state
- Active topics and unresolved questions
- Temporary variables (e.g., frames being compared)

**Implementation:**
- In-memory storage with session persistence
- Complete message history with timestamps
- Turn-by-turn dialogue tracking
- Message importance scoring for retrieval prioritization

### 2. Long-term Customer Memory

Long-term memory persists across sessions and builds a comprehensive customer profile over time.

**Contents:**
- Persistent preferences and requirements
- Purchase history
- Previous fit issues or concerns
- Style preferences
- Budget constraints
- Previously viewed or favorited products

**Implementation:**
- Database storage linked to customer profile
- Preference strength scoring (explicit vs. inferred)
- Temporal weighting (recent preferences weighted higher)
- Confidence scoring for inferred preferences

### 3. Working Memory

Working memory combines short-term and long-term memory elements relevant to the current conversation.

**Contents:**
- Active preferences being discussed
- Currently relevant customer history
- Products under consideration
- Current conversation goals and intents

**Implementation:**
- Dynamic memory updating throughout conversation
- Relevance scoring based on conversation flow
- Memory decay for less relevant information
- Attention mechanisms to focus on key information

## Memory Operations

The contextual memory system performs several key operations:

### 1. Memory Storage

Each interaction is processed and stored with relevant metadata:

```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-20T09:30:45.123Z",
  "user_message": "I'm looking for round metal frames in gold",
  "system_response": "I'd be happy to help you find round metal frames in gold. Would you prefer a thicker or thinner frame style?",
  "recognized_intent": "style_preference",
  "extracted_preferences": [
    {
      "attribute": "frame_shape",
      "value": "round",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "source": "explicit"
    },
    {
      "attribute": "frame_material",
      "value": "metal",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "source": "explicit"
    },
    {
      "attribute": "frame_color",
      "value": "gold",
      "confidence": 0.94,
      "source": "explicit"
    }
  ],
  "products_referenced": [],
  "conversation_state": "collecting_style_preferences"
}
```

### 2. Memory Retrieval

The system retrieves relevant memories using several methods:

- **Recency-based retrieval**: Prioritizing recent interactions
- **Semantic retrieval**: Finding conceptually similar content
- **Intent-based retrieval**: Retrieving memories related to current intent
- **Entity-based retrieval**: Finding mentions of specific products, attributes, etc.
- **Query-based retrieval**: Targeted retrieval based on specific questions

### 3. Reference Resolution

The system resolves references to previously mentioned entities:

- **Pronoun resolution**: Mapping pronouns (it, they, those) to specific entities
- **Anaphora resolution**: Resolving references like "the blue ones"
- **Product reference tracking**: Maintaining which products are being discussed
- **Comparison references**: Understanding statements like "I prefer the first option"

### 4. Memory Consolidation

The system periodically consolidates memories to extract meaningful patterns:

- Identifying consistent preferences across sessions
- Recognizing pattern changes over time
- Merging related preferences and requirements
- Resolving conflicting preferences with recency or strength prioritization

## Contextual Understanding

The contextual memory system powers several forms of contextual understanding:

### 1. Attribute-based Context

Tracking and referencing specific eyewear attributes:

**Example Dialogue:**
```
User: "I'm looking for round glasses."
System: "I'd be happy to show you our round frames. Do you have a preference for material?"
User: "I prefer metal."
System: "Great choice! Metal frames with round shapes are very popular. Do you have a color preference for these metal round frames?"
```

### 2. Product-based Context

Maintaining awareness of which products are being discussed:

**Example Dialogue:**
```
User: "Can you show me the Ray-Ban Clubmaster?"
System: "Here's the Ray-Ban Clubmaster. It comes in several colors including black, tortoise, and brown."
User: "Does it come with polarized lenses?"
System: "Yes, the Ray-Ban Clubmaster is available with polarized lenses for an additional $40."
```

### 3. Comparison Context

Facilitating comparison between multiple products:

**Example Dialogue:**
```
User: "I'm deciding between the Warby Parker Percey and the Oliver Peoples Gregory Peck."
System: "Both are excellent choices. The Percey has a rounder shape while the Gregory Peck has more of a rounded square shape."
User: "Which one is more durable?"
System: "The Oliver Peoples Gregory Peck is made with premium acetate that's slightly more durable, but the Warby Parker Percey comes with a 1-year no-scratch guarantee on the lenses."
```

### 4. Session-spanning Context

Recalling information from previous sessions:

**Example Dialogue (New Session):**
```
System: "Welcome back! Last time you were looking at round metal frames in gold. Would you like to continue where we left off?"
User: "Yes, but I think I want to try titanium instead of regular metal."
System: "Great choice! Titanium is lighter and more durable. Here are some round titanium frames in gold that match your preferences."
```

## Real-time Context Processing

The system processes context in real-time during conversations:

1. **Pre-response Context Integration**: Before generating a response, the system:
   - Retrieves relevant conversation history
   - Accesses customer profile information
   - Resolves references to previous messages
   - Identifies products and attributes being discussed

2. **Post-response Memory Update**: After sending a response, the system:
   - Updates the conversation history
   - Extracts and stores new preferences
   - Updates relevance scores for memories
   - Tracks conversation state changes

## Context Window Management

The system manages a sliding context window to handle limitations in context processing:

- **Prioritized Message Selection**: Including the most relevant past messages
- **Context Summarization**: Condensing long conversation history into key points
- **Entity Tracking**: Maintaining a list of active entities regardless of window size
- **State Representation**: Encoding conversation state efficiently

## Privacy and Security

The contextual memory system incorporates several privacy and security measures:

- **Consent-based Memory**: Only storing information with customer consent
- **Memory Expiration**: Automatic expiration of certain data types
- **Access Controls**: Tiered access to memory data based on employee roles
- **Data Minimization**: Only storing necessary information
- **Anonymization**: De-identifying data used for analytics
- **Opt-out Options**: Allowing customers to delete stored preferences

## Performance Considerations

To ensure responsive performance, the memory system:

- Uses memory caching for active conversations
- Pre-fetches likely relevant memories based on conversation direction
- Implements asynchronous memory updates that don't block responses
- Prioritizes critical memory operations (e.g., reference resolution)
- Scales horizontally for memory storage and retrieval operations

## Integration Points

The Contextual Memory system integrates with:

- **Intent Recognition**: To understand the purpose of user messages
- **Preference Extraction**: To identify and store customer preferences
- **Response Generator**: To craft contextually relevant responses
- **Product Catalog**: To reference and track products mentioned in conversation
- **Customer Profile Database**: To persist preferences across sessions
- **Analytics System**: To analyze conversation patterns and outcomes

## Success Metrics

We measure the effectiveness of our contextual memory through:

1. **Context Accuracy**: % of references correctly resolved (target: >90%)
2. **Memory Utilization**: % of responses that leverage contextual memory (target: >75%)
3. **Memory Precision**: % of retrieved memories that are relevant to current context (target: >85%)
