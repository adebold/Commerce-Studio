# Intent Recognition System

## Overview

The Intent Recognition system is a fundamental component of our conversational AI engine, enabling the platform to understand the underlying purpose of customer messages. By accurately identifying customer intent, we can provide relevant responses, extract meaningful information, and guide the conversation flow effectively.

## Intent Categories

Our system recognizes the following primary intent categories relevant to eyewear shopping:

### Style Preferences

These intents relate to the aesthetic aspects of eyewear, including:

- Frame shape preferences (round, square, cat-eye, aviator, etc.)
- Color preferences (black, tortoiseshell, clear, metallic, etc.)
- Material preferences (acetate, metal, titanium, etc.)
- Brand preferences (Ray-Ban, Warby Parker, Gucci, etc.)
- Style inspirations (vintage, minimalist, bold, professional, etc.)

**Example Utterances:**
- "I'm looking for something with a retro vibe."
- "I prefer thin metal frames in gold or silver."
- "Do you have any cat-eye frames in tortoiseshell?"
- "I want something that looks professional for work meetings."

### Fit Requirements

These intents relate to the physical fit and comfort of eyewear:

- Face shape considerations (oval, round, square, heart-shaped, etc.)
- Size requirements (narrow, standard, wide, etc.)
- Fit issues (sliding down, pinching, etc.)
- Bridge fit preferences (nose pads, keyhole bridge, etc.)
- Temple length and style preferences
- Weight considerations (lightweight, substantial, etc.)

**Example Utterances:**
- "I have a wide face and need glasses that won't pinch."
- "My glasses always slide down my nose."
- "I need something lightweight that I can wear all day."
- "What frame shape works best for my round face?"

### Budget Concerns

These intents relate to pricing and value considerations:

- Price range inquiries
- Insurance coverage questions
- Discount or promotion inquiries
- Value comparison requests
- Financing options

**Example Utterances:**
- "What frames do you have under $200?"
- "Does my insurance cover these frames?"
- "Are there any ongoing promotions I should know about?"
- "Why are these frames more expensive than others?"

### Prescription Needs

These intents relate to vision correction requirements:

- Prescription type inquiries (single vision, progressive, bifocal, etc.)
- Lens material questions (standard, high-index, polycarbonate, etc.)
- Lens coating inquiries (anti-reflective, blue light filtering, etc.)
- Vision condition-specific questions (astigmatism, presbyopia, etc.)

**Example Utterances:**
- "I need glasses for reading only."
- "What lens options do you recommend for a strong prescription?"
- "Do you offer blue light filtering lenses?"
- "I have astigmatism. What should I consider?"

### Product Information

These intents seek specific information about products:

- Feature inquiries
- Material specifications
- Availability checks
- Dimension questions
- Comparison requests

**Example Utterances:**
- "What's the difference between these two frames?"
- "Are these frames adjustable?"
- "Do you have this model in stock?"
- "What are the dimensions of these frames?"

### Support and Services

These intents relate to customer service and additional services:

- Order status inquiries
- Return policy questions
- Warranty information requests
- Adjustment and repair queries
- Try-on service inquiries

**Example Utterances:**
- "How can I track my order?"
- "What's your return policy?"
- "Do you offer virtual try-on?"
- "Can you adjust frames that I purchased elsewhere?"

## Intent Recognition Approach

Our intent recognition system uses a multi-layered approach:

### 1. Pre-processing

Before intent classification, messages undergo several pre-processing steps:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down messages into words and phrases
- **Normalization**: Converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, etc.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying product names, brands, colors, etc.
- **Spelling Correction**: Fixing common misspellings of eyewear terminology

### 2. Primary Intent Classification

The primary classification layer identifies the high-level intent category:

- **Model**: Fine-tuned language model (GPT-4 or equivalent)
- **Training Data**: Curated dataset of eyewear-specific customer inquiries
- **Classification Method**: Hierarchical classification starting with primary intent
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probability score for each potential intent category

### 3. Sub-intent Identification

Once the primary intent is identified, we extract more granular sub-intents:

- **Frame Style Sub-intents**: Shape, color, material, etc.
- **Fit Sub-intents**: Size issues, comfort concerns, face shape compatibility, etc.
- **Budget Sub-intents**: Price range, discount inquiries, etc.

### 4. Entity Extraction

In parallel with intent classification, we extract specific entities mentioned:

- **Product Entities**: Frame models, lens types, etc.
- **Attribute Entities**: Colors, materials, shapes, sizes, etc.
- **Numerical Entities**: Prices, measurements, etc.
- **Temporal Entities**: Delivery timeframes, appointment slots, etc.

### 5. Intent Resolution

The system resolves the final intent by combining:

- Primary intent classification
- Sub-intent identification
- Extracted entities
- Conversation context
- User profile information

## Handling Multi-intent Messages

Many customer messages contain multiple intents. Our system:

1. Identifies all intents present in a message
2. Prioritizes intents based on:
   - Explicit vs. implicit intent signals
   - Conversation flow and context
   - Business priority (e.g., addressing fit concerns before style preferences)
3. Addresses intents sequentially or in a combined response when appropriate

## Handling Ambiguity

When intent recognition confidence is low or multiple intents have similar confidence scores:

1. The system generates clarification questions
2. Uses visual cues in the UI to suggest possible intents
3. Offers quick-reply options to help specify intent
4. Falls back to generalized responses that address multiple potential intents

## Intent-Specific Flows

Once an intent is recognized, the system triggers intent-specific conversation flows:

- **Style Preference Flow**: Guides customers through style options, shows visually similar frames
- **Fit Requirements Flow**: Asks about face shape, provides sizing guidance
- **Budget Flow**: Suggests frames within specified price range, explains price differences
- **Prescription Flow**: Collects prescription details, explains lens options

## Continuous Improvement

Our intent recognition system improves through:

1. **Human Review**: Regular review of low-confidence classifications
2. **Customer Feedback**: Analyzing instances where customers correct the system
3. **A/B Testing**: Comparing different intent classification approaches
4. **Retraining**: Periodic model retraining with expanded datasets
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Tuning to specific customer demographics and regional language patterns

## Integration Points

The Intent Recognition system integrates with:

- **Context Manager**: To incorporate conversation history
- **Preference Extraction**: To identify and store customer preferences
- **Response Generator**: To craft appropriate responses based on intent
- **Product Catalog**: To match intents with relevant products
- **Analytics System**: To track intent distribution and recognition accuracy

## Performance Metrics

We measure intent recognition performance through:

1. **Recognition Accuracy**: % of correctly classified intents (target: >95%)
2. **Confidence Distribution**: Distribution of confidence scores across intents
3. **Clarification Rate**: % of interactions requiring intent clarification (target: <15%)
4. **First-time Resolution**: % of intents addressed in first response (target: >80%)
5. **Intent Distribution**: Breakdown of encountered intents to inform product development
