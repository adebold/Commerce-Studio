# Conversational AI Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and mitigation strategies for the EyewearML Conversational AI system.

## Security Overview

Our conversational AI system handles sensitive user data including style preferences, eyewear needs, and potentially personal information. Ensuring the security of this data is a top priority.

## Dependency Management and Vulnerability Mitigation

### Identified Vulnerability Issues

When installing dependencies without version pinning (e.g., `npm install express firebase-admin dotenv body-parser cors`), numerous vulnerabilities can be introduced through transitive dependencies. These vulnerabilities might include:

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Prototype pollution
- Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)
- Information disclosure
- Path traversal vulnerabilities

### Our Mitigation Strategy

We've implemented the following strategies to mitigate dependency vulnerabilities:

1. **Strict Version Pinning**: All dependencies are pinned to specific versions known to be secure.

2. **Limited Production Dependencies**: We maintain a minimal set of production dependencies to reduce the attack surface.

3. **Security Headers with Helmet**: Added the Helmet package to set secure HTTP headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented Express Rate Limit to prevent abuse and brute force attacks.

5. **Regular Security Audits**: Automated scripts to check for and address vulnerabilities.

### Secure Installation

To install dependencies securely:

```bash
cd src/conversational_ai/package
npm install
```

This will install the exact versions specified in `package.json`, avoiding the introduction of vulnerable dependencies.

### Security Scanning

We've added npm scripts to facilitate regular security checks:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities in production dependencies
npm run audit

# Check for available updates
npm run check-updates

# Update minor versions safely and fix vulnerabilities
npm run update-safe
```

## Firebase Security Best Practices

For the Firebase Firestore integration, we follow these security practices:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Service accounts are granted only the permissions they need.

2. **Secure Credential Storage**: Firebase credentials are never committed to the repository and are stored as environment variables.

3. **Firestore Security Rules**: Implement strict security rules in Firestore that validate user authentication and request data.

Example Firestore security rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /conversationContexts/{userId} {
      // Only allow read/write to a user's own data
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## API Security

Our conversational AI system includes webhook APIs that should be secured:

1. **Authentication**: All API endpoints should require authentication.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate all input data before processing.

3. **CORS Configuration**: Only allow requests from trusted origins.

4. **Request Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

5. **HTTPS Only**: All API communication must use HTTPS.

## Dialogflow Security Considerations

When using Dialogflow CX:

1. **API Key Security**: Store Dialogflow API keys securely as environment variables.

2. **Intent Data Sanitization**: Sanitize all data coming from Dialogflow intents before using it in your application.

3. **Session Management**: Implement secure session management for conversational state.

## Secure Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run `npm audit` and address critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Ensure Firebase service account has minimal permissions
- [ ] Configure CORS to allow only necessary origins
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure Helmet with appropriate security headers
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Test for common security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection)
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules
- [ ] Ensure all communication is over HTTPS
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

To maintain security over time:

1. **Scheduled Dependency Updates**: Set a regular schedule (at least monthly) to update dependencies to their latest secure versions.

2. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Security Patch Process**: Establish a process for quickly applying security patches when vulnerabilities are discovered.

4. **Security Incident Response Plan**: Document procedures for responding to security incidents.
