# Google NLP Implementation for EyewearML Conversational AI

This directory contains the implementation plan and agentic development prompts for building the EyewearML conversational AI engine using Google's Natural Language Processing (NLP) services.

## Overview

The implementation strategy focuses on leveraging Google's mature NLP services (primarily Dialogflow CX) to accelerate development, reduce technical risk, and focus custom development efforts on eyewear-specific differentiation. This approach allows for:

- MVP release in 8-10 weeks rather than 26 weeks
- 40% lower development costs compared to building everything from scratch
- Reduced technical risk through use of proven services
- Focus on eyewear-specific value rather than general NLP infrastructure

## Implementation Approach

The implementation is structured in four progressive phases:

1. **MVP Implementation (Weeks 1-8)**: Core functionality with Google Cloud setup, Dialogflow agent, basic conversation flows, and initial integrations
2. **Enhanced Capabilities (Weeks 9-14)**: Visual AI integration, rich responses, e-commerce features, and analytics
3. **Platform Expansion (Weeks 15-20)**: Additional e-commerce platforms, advanced personalization, and developer tools
4. **Optimization and Handoff (Weeks 21-24)**: Performance optimization, scalability, monitoring, documentation, and training

## Document Structure

### Strategic Documents

- [CTO Strategic Considerations](../cto_strategic_considerations.md): Strategic rationale for using Google NLP services and overall approach
- [Integration Strategy](../integration_strategy.md): How the conversational AI integrates with other EyewearML components
- [Implementation Steps](../google_nlp_implementation_steps.md): Week-by-week action plan with specific deliverables

### Agentic Development Prompts

Each phase has a set of agentic prompts that define specific development tasks:

- [Phase 1: MVP Implementation](phase1_agentic_prompts.md): 8 prompts for core implementation
- [Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities](phase2_agentic_prompts.md): 8 prompts for advanced features
- [Phase 3: Platform Expansion](phase3_agentic_prompts.md): 8 prompts for platform expansion
- [Phase 4: Optimization and Handoff](phase4_agentic_prompts.md): 8 prompts for optimization and operations

## Using the Agentic Prompts

The agentic prompts are designed to be actionable development tasks that can be assigned to developers. Each prompt includes:

1. **Task**: Clear definition of what needs to be done
2. **Context**: Background information and why the task is important
3. **Requirements**: Specific functional requirements to be met
4. **Implementation Details**: Technical guidance on implementation approach
5. **Expected Deliverables**: Concrete outputs the task should produce
6. **Related Files**: Where the implementation should be placed

Development teams should:

1. Start with Phase 1 prompts in sequence
2. Assign prompts to appropriate team members based on expertise
3. Use the implementation details as guidance, not strict requirements
4. Ensure deliverables meet the specified requirements
5. Progress to subsequent phases after completing earlier ones

## Key Technologies

- **Google Dialogflow CX**: Core conversation management, intent recognition, and entity extraction
- **Google Natural Language API**: Enhanced entity recognition and sentiment analysis
- **Google Cloud Functions/Cloud Run**: Webhook services for custom business logic
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Asset and data storage
- **Google Analytics**: Conversation analytics and tracking

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. Start with the [Google Cloud Project Setup](phase1_agentic_prompts.md#prompt-1-google-cloud-project-setup) prompt
2. Set up development environments according to the prompt requirements
3. Proceed through the Phase 1 prompts in sequence
4. Use the [Integration Strategy](../integration_strategy.md) as a reference for connections to other platform components
5. Refer to the [Implementation Steps](../google_nlp_implementation_steps.md) for timeline and planning

## Development Best Practices

- Use version control for all configuration and code
- Implement CI/CD pipelines early in the process
- Create test cases for all conversation flows
- Document API contracts before implementation
- Maintain a staging environment that mirrors production
- Implement monitoring from the beginning
