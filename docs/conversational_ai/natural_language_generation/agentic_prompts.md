# Natural Language Generation System - Agentic Development Prompts

This document contains agentic prompts for implementing the Natural Language Generation (NLG) system for our conversational AI engine. Each prompt represents a specific development task that can be implemented independently.

## Implementation Approach

The natural language generation system will be developed in the following stages:

1. Response planning and content selection
2. Template-based generation system
3. Neural language generation integration
4. Response enhancement and personalization
5. Quality assurance and evaluation

## Prompt 1: Response Planning and Content Selection

**Task:** Design and implement the response planning and content selection system that determines what information to include in responses.

**Context:** Before generating natural language, the system needs to decide what information to include based on the recognized intent, conversation context, and available information.

**Implementation Details:**
- Design information source integrations (product catalog, knowledge base, etc.)
- Implement context-aware content relevance scoring
- Create adaptive response strategies based on conversation flow
- Develop structures for representing response plans
- Design for extensibility to add new response types and strategies

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Response planning architecture document
- Content selection implementation
- Response strategy definitions
- Integration with intent and context systems
- Unit tests for different conversation scenarios

- `/tests/conversational_ai/nlg/test_response_planning.py`

## Prompt 2: Template-Based Generation System

**Task:** Implement a flexible, context-aware template system for generating responses.

**Context:** While neural generation provides flexibility, a template-based approach ensures reliability, control, and efficiency for common responses. The system should provide a robust template framework that supports dynamic content insertion and variation.

**Requirements:**
- Design a template language for natural, varied responses
- Create a template management system with categorization and retrieval
- Implement dynamic content insertion with proper formatting
- Develop template selection algorithms based on context
- Create template variation mechanisms to avoid repetitiveness

**Implementation Details:**
- Use a flexible templating engine (Jinja2 or similar)
- Implement template categorization by intent and response type
- Create fallback chains for template selection
- Design for internationalization support
- Include template performance analytics

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Template system implementation
- Template language documentation
- Initial template library for eyewear domain
- Template selection and retrieval utilities
- Unit tests for template rendering

- `/data/conversational_ai/templates/`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/nlg/test_templates.py`

## Prompt 3: Neural Language Generation Integration

**Task:** Integrate and fine-tune a neural language generation system for producing natural, contextually appropriate responses.

**Context:** Modern conversational systems benefit from neural language models that can generate flexible, natural-sounding text. This component should integrate such capabilities while ensuring reliability and control.

**Requirements:**
- Design the integration architecture for neural language generation
- Implement prompt engineering for reliable, consistent outputs

**Implementation Details:**
- Integrate with modern language models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Design prompt templates for different response scenarios
- Implement controllable generation with guidance parameters
- Create evaluation metrics for generation quality
- Design a hybrid approach combining templates and neural generation

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Neural generation integration implementation
- Prompt engineering documentation
- Parameter optimization utilities
- Evaluation and benchmarking suite
- Integration tests with real-world examples

- `/tests/conversational_ai/nlg/test_neural_generation.py`

## Prompt 4: Response Enhancement and Personalization

**Task:** Develop systems for enhancing generated responses with personalization, empathy, and brand voice.

**Context:** Beyond basic response generation, the system should personalize responses based on customer preferences, add appropriate empathetic elements, and maintain consistent brand voice.

**Requirements:**
- Design a response enhancement pipeline
- Implement personalization based on customer profile and history
- Create brand voice consistency enforcement
- Develop empathy and rapport-building elements
- Implement adaptive communication style based on customer interactions

**Implementation Details:**

## Prompt 5: Multi-turn Response Planning

**Task:** Implement a system for planning and executing multi-turn conversation strategies.

**Context:** Effective conversations often require multi-turn strategies, such as gathering preferences before making recommendations or explaining complex topics across multiple messages.

**Requirements:**
- Design a multi-turn conversation planning system
- Implement state tracking for conversation flows
- Create transition handling between different stages
- Develop interruption handling and recovery
- Implement dynamic plan adjustment based on user responses

**Implementation Details:**
