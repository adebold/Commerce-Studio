# Intent Recognition System - Agentic Development Prompts

This document contains agentic prompts for implementing the Intent Recognition system for our conversational AI engine. Each prompt represents a specific development task that can be implemented independently.

## Implementation Approach

The intent recognition system will be developed in the following stages:

1. Basic intent classification model
2. Entity extraction system
3. Sub-intent identification
4. Enhanced context integration
5. Testing and evaluation framework

## Prompt 1: Intent Classification Model Architecture

**Task:** Design and implement the core intent classification model architecture for eyewear-specific intents.

**Context:** The conversational AI needs to accurately identify various customer intents related to eyewear shopping, such as style preferences, fit requirements, budget concerns, and prescription needs.

**Requirements:**
- Design a flexible, extensible architecture for the intent classifier
- Select appropriate model architecture (transformer-based, hierarchical, etc.)
- Define model input/output formats and API contracts
- Include configuration system for model parameters
- Provide guidance on training data structure

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Python with modern ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Consider both pretrained model fine-tuning and custom model development
- Design for both online and offline inference modes
- Ensure compatibility with our overall conversational AI architecture
- Include proper error handling and confidence scoring mechanisms

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Intent classifier architecture design document
- Core model implementation with skeleton classes
- Sample configuration
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Jupyter notebook demonstrating basic usage

- `/src/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/config.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/test_model.py`

## Prompt 2: Eyewear-Specific Intent Categories and Training Data

**Task:** Define a comprehensive taxonomy of eyewear-specific intents and develop a strategy for training data collection and annotation.

**Context:** To effectively train our intent recognition system, we need a well-defined set of intent categories specific to eyewear shopping, along with properly labeled training examples.

**Requirements:**
- Create a hierarchical taxonomy of eyewear-specific intents
- Define annotation guidelines for training data
- Develop strategies for synthetic training data generation
- Create annotation tools or processes for human annotators
- Define data augmentation techniques specific to conversational data

**Implementation Details:**
- Document at least 6 primary intent categories with sub-intents
- Create annotation schema with examples for each intent type
- Develop scripts for training data generation and augmentation
- Consider few-shot learning approaches for low-resource intents
- Include intent verification and validation methods

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Intent taxonomy documentation
- Annotation guidelines and examples
- Training data generation scripts
- Annotation validation tools
- Initial labeled dataset (at least 100 examples per primary intent)

- `/data/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/training_examples.json`

## Prompt 3: Named Entity Recognition for Eyewear Attributes

**Task:** Develop a named entity recognition system specifically for eyewear-related entities such as frame types, brands, materials, and styles.

**Context:** Beyond understanding the general intent of a customer's message, our system needs to extract specific entities like frame shapes, colors, brands, and materials to properly respond to queries and capture preferences.

**Requirements:**
- Design an entity extraction system for eyewear-specific entities
- Create a comprehensive taxonomy of entity types and values
- Develop methods for entity normalization and disambiguation
- Ensure entity extraction works within the context of different intents
- Implement confidence scoring for extracted entities

**Implementation Details:**
- Use modern NER approaches (CRF, BiLSTM-CRF, or transformer-based)
- Consider both rule-based and ML-based approaches for different entity types
- Implement gazetteers for known entity values (brands, common colors, etc.)
- Develop entity linking to our product catalog
- Ensure language variations and misspellings are handled

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Entity extraction module implementation
- Entity type definitions and schema
- Entity normalization utilities
- Unit tests and evaluation metrics
- Documentation on extending the entity recognition system

**Related Files:**
- `/src/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/entity_extraction.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/entity_types.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/test_entity_extraction.py`

## Prompt 4: Context-Aware Intent Resolution

**Task:** Develop a system for resolving intents based on conversation history and context.

**Context:** Intent recognition shouldn't happen in isolation but should consider previous messages, detected entities, and the overall state of the conversation.

**Requirements:**
- Design a context integration system for intent recognition
- Implement methods to incorporate conversation history in intent classification
- Create logic for resolving ambiguous intents based on context
- Develop a system for tracking conversation flow across intents
- Implement hand-off protocols between different intent handlers

**Implementation Details:**
- Design state tracking for conversation flows
- Implement features that incorporate previous n-turns of conversation
- Create weighted models that balance current message and conversation history
- Develop confidence thresholds and fallback mechanisms
- Consider intent sequences and typical conversation patterns

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Context integration module implementation
- Conversation state tracking utilities
- Ambiguity resolution algorithms
- Integration tests with conversation flows
- Documentation on extending and configuring context integration

**Related Files:**
- `/src/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/context_integration.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/state_tracking.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/intent_recognition/test_context_integration.py`

## Prompt 5: Intent Recognition API and Service Integration

**Task:** Develop the service-level API for intent recognition that integrates with the broader conversational AI system.

**Context:** The intent recognition module needs to expose well-defined APIs that other components (context manager, response generator, etc.) can utilize.

**Requirements:**
- Design a clean, well-documented API for the intent recognition service
- Implement synchronous and asynchronous processing modes
- Create serialization/deserialization for intent and entity data
- Develop integration points with other conversational AI components
- Implement proper logging, monitoring, and error handling

**Implementation Details:**
- Design RESTful and/or gRPC interfaces for the service
- Create proper request/response schemas
- Implement service-level caching and performance optimizations
- Develop health checks and status endpoints
- Create operational metrics for model performance

**Expected Deliverables:**
- API specification document
- Service implementation
- Integration tests with other conversational AI components
- Performance tests and benchmarks
- Deployment configuration
