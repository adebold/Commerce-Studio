# Contextual Memory System - Agentic Development Prompts

This document contains agentic prompts for implementing the Contextual Memory system for our conversational AI engine. Each prompt represents a specific development task that can be implemented independently.

## Implementation Approach

The contextual memory system will be developed in the following stages:

1. Memory data model and storage architecture
2. Memory operations (storage, retrieval, reference resolution)
3. Context window management
4. Integration with other components
5. Optimizations and performance tuning

## Prompt 1: Contextual Memory Data Model

**Task:** Design and implement the core data model for the contextual memory system.

**Context:** The conversational AI needs a sophisticated memory system to maintain conversation history, track preferences, and store relevant context across multiple turns and potentially across sessions.

**Requirements:**
- Design a comprehensive data model for short-term and long-term memory
- Define schema for conversations, messages, preferences, and entities
- Create appropriate indexing strategies for efficient retrieval
- Design timestamp and versioning mechanisms
- Include methods for memory serialization/deserialization

**Implementation Details:**
- Use a combination of relational and document models
- Design for both in-memory and persistent storage
- Include proper data validation and schema enforcement
- Consider GDPR and privacy requirements in the design
- Account for both session-level and user-level persistence

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Memory data model documentation
- Core schema implementations
- Database migration scripts
- Sample memory instances
- Unit tests for core functionality

- `/src/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/schema.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/test_models.py`

## Prompt 2: Vector-Based Memory Storage and Retrieval

**Task:** Implement a vector-based memory system for semantic search and retrieval of conversation history and context.

**Context:** Modern conversational systems benefit from semantic search capabilities that allow retrieving relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

**Requirements:**
- Design a vector storage system for conversational memories
- Implement embeddings generation for messages and entities
- Create efficient retrieval mechanisms based on semantic similarity
- Develop relevance scoring algorithms
- Implement filtering and pagination for memory retrieval

**Implementation Details:**
- Use modern embedding models (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- Integrate with vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, or similar)
- Implement batching for efficient processing
- Consider dimensionality reduction techniques for storage efficiency
- Design for both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Vector memory implementation
- Embedding generation utilities
- Retrieval API with filtering capabilities
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests with sample conversations

- `/src/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/embeddings.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/test_vector_store.py`

## Prompt 3: Reference Resolution System

**Task:** Develop a system for resolving references (pronouns, anaphora, etc.) within conversations.

**Context:** Natural conversations often contain references to previously mentioned entities or concepts through pronouns or partial descriptions. The system needs to resolve these references for proper understanding.

**Requirements:**
- Design a reference resolution system for conversational context
- Implement pronoun resolution algorithms
- Create methods for resolving references to products, attributes, and entities
- Develop confidence scoring for reference resolution
- Implement fallback mechanisms for ambiguous references

**Implementation Details:**
- Use both rule-based and ML-based approaches
- Consider recency and salience factors in resolution
- Track entity mentions throughout the conversation
- Implement contextual restrictions for reference candidates
- Design for multi-turn resolution where needed

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Reference resolution implementation
- Entity tracking system
- Confidence scoring mechanism
- Evaluation metrics and test suite
- Documentation on extending the reference resolution system

- `/src/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/reference_resolution.py`
- `/src/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/entity_tracking.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/test_reference_resolution.py`

## Prompt 4: Context Window Management

**Task:** Implement a system for managing the context window that optimizes for relevance and token efficiency.

**Context:** Language models and conversational systems have limitations on how much context they can process at once. The system needs to intelligently manage which memories to include in the active context.

**Requirements:**
- Design a context window management system
- Implement prioritization algorithms for memory selection
- Create methods for context summarization and compression
- Develop strategies for handling long conversations
- Implement context window updating policies

**Implementation Details:**
- Consider both token count and semantic importance
- Implement sliding windows with prioritized retention
- Create mechanisms for context state representation
- Design for different context window sizes based on deployment scenarios
- Include safeguards against context loss

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Context window management implementation
- Memory prioritization algorithms
- Context summarization utilities
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Documentation on configuring context management

- `/src/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/prioritization.py`
- `/tests/conversational_ai/contextual_memory/test_context_window.py`

## Prompt 5: Memory Consolidation and Pattern Recognition

**Task:** Develop a system for memory consolidation that can identify patterns and extract insights from conversation history.

**Context:** Beyond simply storing conversation history, the system should be able to consolidate memories, identify patterns, and extract higher-level insights that can inform the conversation.

**Requirements:**
- Design a memory consolidation system
- Implement pattern recognition for preferences and behavior
- Create algorithms for identifying consistent vs. changing preferences
- Develop utilities for preference strength assessment
- Implement memory update mechanisms based on new information

**Implementation Details:**
- Use statistical and ML approaches for pattern identification
- Consider temporal aspects of preferences and behaviors
- Implement conflict resolution for contradictory preferences
- Design for both explicit and implicit preference signals
- Include confidence scoring for extracted patterns

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Memory consolidation implementation
- Pattern recognition utilities
- Preference strength assessment algorithms
- Temporal analysis functions
- Documentation and example usage

## Prompt 6: Cross-Session Memory and User Profiles

**Task:** Implement a system for maintaining and utilizing memory across multiple sessions.

**Context:** For returning customers, the system should be able to reference previous interactions and maintain a consistent understanding of their preferences and history.

**Requirements:**
- Design a cross-session memory architecture
