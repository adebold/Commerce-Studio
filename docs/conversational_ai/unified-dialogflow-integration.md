# Unified Dialogflow Service Integration

## Overview

The Unified Dialogflow Service consolidates all Dialogflow CX functionality across the Commerce Studio platform, creating a single point of integration that leverages the extensive existing Dialogflow infrastructure documented throughout the project.

## Strategic Decision: Google Cloud as Primary

Based on the comprehensive analysis of existing Dialogflow usage across the project, we have standardized on Google Cloud services as the primary AI platform:

- **Primary**: Google Cloud (Speech + Unified Dialogflow CX)
- **Fallback**: NVIDIA (Riva + Merlin)
- **Emergency**: Mock services

## Unified Service Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Unified Dialogflow Service** (`services/google/unified-dialogflow-service.js`)
   - Consolidates all conversation flows
   - Integrates with existing ML platform
   - Supports visual analysis triggers
   - Manages session state and context

2. **Google Speech Service** (`services/google/google-speech-service.js`)
   - Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
   - Replaces NVIDIA Riva as primary

3. **Updated Demo Server** (`demo/live-demo/live-demo-server.js`)
   - Google services as primary initialization
   - NVIDIA services as fallback
   - Graceful degradation to mock services

## Existing Dialogflow Integration Points

The unified service consolidates these existing Dialogflow implementations found across the project:

### 1. Executive Overview Integration

### 2. Vertex AI Integration
- **Location**: `docs/varai/vertex_ai_integration/`
- **Usage**: Hybrid approach with Dialogflow CX for specialized domain handlers
- **Integration**: Intent-based routing between Vertex AI and Dialogflow CX

### 3. Conversational AI System
- **Location**: `docs/conversational_ai/`
- **Usage**: Core conversation management and intent classification
- **Components**: Agent configuration, webhook service, conversation flows

### 4. Implementation Guides

- **Features**: Agent creation, flow configuration, webhook integration

### 5. Integration Documentation
- **Location**: `docs/integration/`
- **Usage**: ML platform integration with Dialogflow fulfillment
- **Components**: Webhook handlers, fulfillment configuration

## Conversation Flows Consolidated

The unified service supports all existing conversation flows:

### Core Eyewear Flows
1. **Style Recommendation Flow**
   - Intent: `style.recommendation` → `recommendation.style`
   - Triggers: ML recommendation engine
   - Context: Face shape, style preferences, lifestyle

2. **Frame Finder Flow**
   - Intent: `frame.finder` → `recommendation.frame`
   - Triggers: Product catalog search
   - Context: Frame type, budget, brand preferences

3. **Fit Consultation Flow**
   - Intent: `fit.consultation` → `consultation.fit`
   - Triggers: Visual analysis, measurement guidance
   - Context: Prescription, face measurements, comfort preferences

4. **Virtual Try-On Flow**
   - Intent: `virtual.tryon` → `tryon.virtual`
   - Triggers: Visual AI integration
   - Context: Selected frames, face analysis results

5. **Cart Management Flow**
   - Intent: `cart.*` → `cart.*`
   - Triggers: E-commerce integration
   - Context: Shopping session, selected products

6. **Visual Analysis Flow**
   - Intent: `visual.analysis` → `analysis.visual`
   - Triggers: Computer vision services
   - Context: Uploaded images, analysis parameters

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### ML Platform Integration
- Leverages existing ML recommendation handlers
- Integrates with `src/ml/client/webhook_integration.js`
- Uses established fulfillment tags (`recommendation.style`, `recommendation.frame`, etc.)

### Webhook Service Integration
- Compatible with existing webhook architecture
- Supports all documented fulfillment configurations
- Maintains existing tag-based routing system

### Analytics Integration
- Integrates with existing Dialogflow Analytics
- Supports custom event tracking
- Compatible with business intelligence systems

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Google Cloud Configuration
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials.json
DIALOGFLOW_LOCATION=us-central1
DIALOGFLOW_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id

# Fallback NVIDIA Configuration (optional)
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your-nvidia-key
NVIDIA_RIVA_ENDPOINT=your-riva-endpoint
NVIDIA_MERLIN_ENDPOINT=your-merlin-endpoint
```

### Service Priority Configuration
The server automatically attempts services in this order:
1. Google Cloud services (primary)
2. NVIDIA services (fallback)
3. Mock services (emergency)

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Unified Architecture
