# Pull Request: Personalized Eyewear Recommendations System

## Description

This PR implements a personalized recommendation system for eyewear products. The system generates AI-driven product recommendations based on customer data, preferences, browsing history, and prescription information. It includes both personalized recommendations as well as popular and trending product endpoints.

## Features Added

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Core algorithm that matches customer preferences with product attributes
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Each product is assigned a personalized compatibility score (0-1)
- **Recommendation Reasoning**: Human-readable explanations for why products were recommended
- **Face Shape Compatibility**: Recommendations consider facial structure compatibility
- **Prescription Compatibility**: Ensures frames are suitable for prescription strength
- **Frame Size Matching**: Recommends frames with similar measurements to preferred sizes
- **Popular & Trending Products**: Additional endpoints for non-personalized discovery
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Signal collection for model improvement over time

## Technical Implementation

- **Recommendation Service**: Implemented core service with embedding generation, similarity scoring, and filtering
- **Data Models**: Created Pydantic models for request/response handling
- **API Endpoints**: Added FastAPI routes for accessing recommendation functionality
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive implementation guide and next steps

## Files Changed

- `src/api/services/recommendation_service.py` (New)
- `src/api/models/recommendations.py` (Enhanced)
- `src/api/routers/recommendations.py` (Enhanced)
- `docs/personalized-recommendations-implementation-next-steps.md` (New)

## How to Test

Test the recommendation system with the following API calls:

### Personalized Recommendations
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/personalized" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "cust123",
    "style_preferences": ["round", "aviator"],
    "face_shape": "oval",
    "price_range": {"min": 50, "max": 200},
    "limit": 5,
    "include_reasoning": true
  }'
```

### Popular Products
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/popular?limit=5&min_price=50&max_price=200"
```

### Trending Products
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/trending?time_period=7d&limit=5"
```

## Next Steps

The current implementation uses placeholder data for ML operations. Future work includes:
1. Integrating with actual ML models for embedding generation and similarity calculations
2. Implementing a vector database for efficient similarity search
3. Adding A/B testing capabilities to measure recommendation effectiveness
4. Adding caching for performance optimization

## Dependencies

- FastAPI for API implementation
- Numpy for vector operations
- Future: Vector database (to be determined)

## Integration Notes

The recommendation system will be integrated with:
- Shopify App for storefront display
- Customer data service for profile information
- Product catalog service for inventory data
