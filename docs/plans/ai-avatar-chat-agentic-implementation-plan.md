## Agentic Workflow Guidelines

### Task Execution Pattern
1. **Read Specifications**: Always start by reading relevant architecture and specification documents
2. **Plan Implementation**: Break down complex tasks into manageable components
3. **Code Generation**: Generate modular, testable code following TDD principles
4. **Integration Testing**: Test each component with existing systems
5. **Documentation**: Document all implementations and decisions
6. **Validation**: Verify functionality meets requirements

### Quality Standards
- **Code Modularity**: All files must be < 500 lines
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for critical components
- **Performance**: Avatar rendering at 30+ FPS, conversation response < 2 seconds
- **Security**: All NVIDIA API keys and sensitive data properly secured
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning if NVIDIA services are unavailable
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Text-based chat when avatar rendering fails
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery instructions

### Integration Points
- **Existing Camera System**: Leverage existing camera interface for gesture recognition
- **Product Catalogs**: Integrate with existing product recommendation systems
- **User Authentication**: Use existing authentication systems
- **Analytics**: Integrate with existing analytics and monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Avatar rendering performance: 30+ FPS on target devices
- ✅ Voice processing latency: < 500ms for speech recognition
- ✅ Conversation response time: < 2 seconds average
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility: 100% feature parity
- ✅ System uptime: 99.9% availability

### Business Metrics
- ✅ User engagement: Increased session duration
- ✅ Conversion rates: Improved purchase completion

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ Test coverage: > 80% for all critical components
- ✅ Code quality: All files < 500 lines, proper documentation
- ✅ Security compliance: All security requirements met
- ✅ Performance benchmarks: All performance targets achieved

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **NVIDIA Service Availability**: Implement fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Issues**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
- **Integration Complexity**: Modular architecture with clear interfaces
- **Scalability Concerns**: Auto-scaling and load balancing

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive user testing and feedback
- **Cost Management**: Monitor NVIDIA service usage and costs
- **Competitive Pressure**: Focus on unique value proposition
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure privacy and data protection

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with NVIDIA service integration setup
2. **Establish Development Environment**: Set up development tools and access
3. **Create Project Structure**: Initialize project directories and configuration
4. **Start Implementation**: Follow the agentic workflow for systematic development
