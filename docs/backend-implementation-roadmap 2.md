2. **Compliance**: Legal review early
3. **Performance**: Set SLA targets
4. **Data Loss**: Automated backups

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- < 1% error rate
- 80%+ test coverage

### Business KPIs
- User authentication success rate > 95%
- Platform sync accuracy > 99%
- Recommendation CTR > 5%
- Virtual try-on completion > 60%

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up development environment and CI/CD
2. **Week 2**: Implement core authentication system
3. **Week 3**: Create first API endpoints with database
4. **Week 4**: Begin platform integration development
5. **Ongoing**: Daily standups, weekly demos, bi-weekly retrospectives

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building out the backend infrastructure needed to support the existing frontend. By following this phased approach, we can deliver value incrementally while maintaining quality and security standards.

The key to success will be:
1. Starting with core infrastructure
2. Building incrementally
3. Testing thoroughly
4. Monitoring everything
5. Iterating based on feedback

With proper execution, we can transform the current UI prototype into a production-ready application within 4-5 months.
