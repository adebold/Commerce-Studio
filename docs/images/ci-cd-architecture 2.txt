# CI/CD Architecture Diagram Description

This text file describes the CI/CD architecture diagram that should be created for the VARAi Platform.

## Diagram Components

The diagram should include the following components:

1. **Source Control**
   - GitHub repository
   - Branch structure (main, develop, feature branches)

2. **CI/CD Orchestration**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - CI workflow
   - CD workflow

3. **Build Process**
   - Code checkout
   - Dependency installation
   - Linting
   - Testing
   - Security scanning
   - Docker image building

4. **Artifact Storage**
   - GitHub Container Registry
   - Docker images with tags

5. **Deployment Environments**
   - Development environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment

6. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform modules
   - Environment-specific configurations

7. **Deployment Process**
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Blue/Green deployment strategy
   - Canary testing

8. **Monitoring and Feedback**
   - Health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Alerts
   - Dashboards

## Flow Diagram

The diagram should show the flow of code from development to production:

1. Developer commits code to feature branch
2. Pull request created to develop branch
3. CI workflow triggered
   - Linting
   - Testing
   - Security scanning
   - Docker image building
4. Pull request reviewed and merged
5. CD workflow triggered for development environment
   - Deploy to development environment
   - Run post-deployment tests
6. Manual approval for staging deployment
7. CD workflow deploys to staging environment
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run post-deployment tests
8. Manual approval for production deployment
9. CD workflow deploys to production environment
   - Blue/Green deployment
   - Canary testing
   - Full deployment
10. Monitoring and feedback

## Design Guidelines

- Use clear, distinct colors for different components
- Include arrows to show the flow of code and data
- Include icons for different services (GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Include a legend to explain the symbols used
- Keep the diagram clean and easy to understand

## Tools for Creating the Diagram

The diagram can be created using tools such as:
- Lucidchart
- draw.io
- Miro
- Microsoft Visio

Once created, export the diagram as a PNG file and save it as `ci-cd-architecture.png` in the `docs/images` directory.
