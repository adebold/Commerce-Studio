## Integration Patterns

VARAi Commerce Studio will implement the following integration patterns to ensure reliable communication between components:

### 1. API-First Integration

All components will expose and consume RESTful APIs with the following characteristics:

- **OpenAPI Specification**: All APIs will be documented using OpenAPI 3.0
- **Versioning**: APIs will use URL versioning (e.g., `/v1/products`)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Pagination**: Consistent pagination for list endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with detailed information

Example API Contract:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Product Catalog API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /v1/products:
    get:
      summary: List products
      parameters:
        - name: page
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
        - name: limit
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  items:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Product'
                  pagination:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pagination'
```

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

For asynchronous communication between components, we will implement an event-driven architecture:

- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
- **Event Schema**: Standardized event schema with versioning
- **Dead Letter Queues**: For handling failed message processing
- **Event Sourcing**: For critical business processes
- **Idempotent Consumers**: To handle duplicate message delivery

Key Events:

| Event Type | Producer | Consumers | Purpose |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| `product.created` | Inventory Service | HTML Store, Shopify Plugin, Reporting | Notify when new products are added |
| `product.updated` | Inventory Service | HTML Store, Shopify Plugin, Reporting | Notify when product details change |
| `order.placed` | HTML Store, Shopify Plugin | Inventory Service, Reporting | Trigger inventory updates and analytics |
| `client.registered` | Client Portal | All Services | Initialize client-specific resources |
| `tryon.completed` | Virtual Try-on | Reporting | Track try-on usage for analytics |

### 3. Shared Data Access

For components that need direct access to shared data:

- **Database Abstraction**: Repository pattern for data access
- **Read Models**: Specialized read models for reporting and analytics
- **Caching**: Distributed caching for frequently accessed data
- **Data Validation**: Consistent validation rules across components
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data modifications

## Component Integration Details

### Client Registration & Portal Integration

The client registration system will integrate with other components through:

1. **User Provisioning Flow**:
   - Client registration triggers `client.registered` event
   - Authentication service creates client credentials
   - Client portal initializes default settings
   - Store management provisions store resources

2. **Single Sign-On**:
   - JWT-based authentication across all components
   - Role-based access control for feature access
   - Session management with refresh tokens
   - Audit logging for security events

3. **Client Settings Propagation**:
   - Central settings service with API access
   - Component-specific settings with inheritance
   - Real-time settings updates via events
   - Validation rules for setting values

### HTML Store & Shopify Integration

The HTML Store and Shopify Plugin will share core functionality through:

1. **Product Catalog Synchronization**:
   - Bidirectional sync between platforms
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Batch processing for large catalogs
   - Delta updates for efficiency

2. **Order Management**:
   - Consistent order processing workflow
   - Status synchronization across platforms
   - Unified order history and reporting
   - Shared fulfillment tracking

3. **Customer Data**:
   - Unified customer profiles
   - Privacy-compliant data sharing
   - Preference synchronization
   - Activity history across platforms

### Plugin Integration

Plugins (Virtual Try-on, PD Calculator) will integrate with the platform through:

1. **Embedding Framework**:
   - JavaScript SDK for frontend integration
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Theme-aware styling
   - Localization support

2. **Data Exchange**:
   - Secure API access for plugin data
   - User context sharing

## External System Integration

### PMS Integration

Integration with Practice Management Systems will be implemented through:

1. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - System-specific adapters for each PMS
   - Common interface for all adapters
   - Configuration-driven connection settings
   - Health monitoring and logging

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Scheduled and on-demand sync options
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Field mapping configuration
   - Validation and error handling

3. **Authentication Methods**:

### 2. Integration Test Suites

- End-to-end test scenarios for key workflows
- Component integration test suites
- Mocked external dependencies
- Realistic test data generation

### 3. Monitoring and Observability

- Distributed tracing across all components
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Structured logging with consistent format
- Health check endpoints for all services

## Deployment and Environment Strategy

To support the integration of components across environments:

### 1. Environment Parity

- Consistent configuration across environments
- Infrastructure-as-code for all environments
- Container-based deployment for consistency
- Database migration automation

### 2. Deployment Coordination

- Semantic versioning for all components
- Compatibility matrix maintenance
- Coordinated release planning
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments

### 3. Feature Flags

- Centralized feature flag management
- Environment-specific flag values
- Gradual rollout capabilities
- A/B testing framework integration
