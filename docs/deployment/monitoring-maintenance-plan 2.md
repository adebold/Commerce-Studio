## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Notification Method |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| P1    | Critical - Service outage or data loss | Immediate (15 min) | Phone call, SMS, Email |
| P2    | High - Significant degradation | 1 hour | SMS, Email |
| P3    | Medium - Minor issues affecting some users | 4 hours | Email |
| P4    | Low - Non-urgent issues | 24 hours | Email, Ticket |

### Alert Configuration

#### Infrastructure Alerts
- Node CPU > 80% for 5 minutes (P2)
- Node memory > 85% for 5 minutes (P2)
- Node disk usage > 85% (P2)
- Pod restarts > 3 in 15 minutes (P2)
- Persistent volume usage > 85% (P3)

#### Application Alerts
- Service availability < 99.9% (P1)
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes (P2)
- API response time > 500ms for 5 minutes (P3)
- Authentication failures > 10 in 1 minute (P2)
- Database query time > 200ms (P3)

#### Business Alerts
- Recommendation service accuracy < 90% (P3)
- User conversion rate drop > 10% (P3)
- Active user count drop > 15% (P2)

### On-Call Rotation
- Primary on-call engineer (24/7 rotation)
- Secondary on-call engineer (backup)
- Escalation to team lead after 30 minutes without response
- Escalation to management after 1 hour without resolution

## Maintenance Procedures

### Routine Maintenance

- Schema optimization (quarterly)
- Performance tuning (monthly)
- Backup verification (weekly)

#### Backup Strategy
- Full database backup (daily)
- Incremental backups (hourly)
- Transaction log backups (every 15 minutes)
- Offsite backup storage
- Regular restoration testing

### Update Management

#### Kubernetes Updates
- Review release notes
