## Deployment Issues and Resolutions

| Issue | Description | Resolution | Status |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Image Pull Errors | Pods unable to pull container images | Need to push images to container registry and update image references | Pending |
| Pending Pods | Some pods stuck in Pending state | Need to verify resource allocation and PVC binding | Pending |
| Kustomization Errors | Issues with Kubernetes kustomization | Fixed by modifying kustomization.yaml to use correct resources | Resolved |
| Secret Management | Difficulty setting up secrets in Google Cloud | Created script to handle essential secrets setup | Resolved |

## Next Steps
