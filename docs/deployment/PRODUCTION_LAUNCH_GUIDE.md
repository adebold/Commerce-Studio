## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the production launch of the AI Avatar Chat System. It details all procedures, checklists, and protocols required to ensure a smooth, zero-downtime deployment.

This launch will activate the AI Avatar across our e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and HTML stores) according to the rollout plan defined in `config/production/launch-configuration.yaml`.

**Deployment Strategy:** Blue-Green Deployment

## 2. Pre-Launch Readiness

### 2.1. Pre-Launch Checklist

Before initiating the launch, ensure all the following criteria are met. The `launch-checklist-validator.js` service automates these checks, but manual verification is recommended as a final safeguard.

| # | Item                               | Status (✅/❌) | Notes                                                              |
|---|------------------------------------|:--------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Code Freeze**                    |       ✅        | No new code merged to `main` branch 24 hours prior to launch.      |
| 2 | **Final Security Scan**            |       ✅        | No new CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities detected.         |
| 3 | **Performance Tests Passed**       |       ✅        | Latest load tests meet all production SLOs.                        |
| 4 | **Compliance Audits Signed Off**   |       ✅        | SOC2 and GDPR audits are complete and passed.                      |
| 5 | **Feature Flags Confirmed**        |       ✅        | Review `launch-configuration.yaml` for correct rollout percentages. |
| 6 | **Rollback Plan Verified**         |       ✅        | The `rollback-service.js` is tested and ready.                     |
| 7 | **On-Call Team Notified**          |       ✅        | SRE and engineering on-call teams are aware of the launch window.  |
| 8 | **Monitoring Dashboards Ready**    |       ✅        | Grafana dashboards for launch metrics are active and tested.       |
| 9 | **Communication Plan Ready**       |       ✅        | Stakeholder communication plan is prepared.                        |

### 2.2. Environment Setup

- Ensure you have `read` and `execute` permissions for the `scripts/` directory.
- Your shell environment must have `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.
- Ensure you have authenticated with the cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) and `kubectl` if applicable.

---

## 3. Launch Procedure

The entire launch process is automated by the `production-launch.sh` script. This script orchestrates the blue-green deployment, including validation, health checks, and traffic switching.

### 3.1. Initiating the Launch

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/commerce-studio
    ```

2.  **Execute the launch script:**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/production-launch.sh
    ```

3.  **Monitor the launch progress:**
    The script will stream logs to your console and save a detailed log file in `logs/deployment/`. Monitor this output closely.

    ```
    tail -f logs/deployment/production-launch-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
    ```

### 3.2. Key Phases of the Automated Launch

1.  **Validation:** The `launch-checklist-validator.js` runs. If any critical check fails, the script will abort.
2.  **Deployment to Blue Environment:** The new version of the application is deployed to the inactive (blue) environment.
3.  **Health Checks & Smoke Tests:** The `health-check-service.js` and automated smoke tests run against the blue environment. Any failure here will trigger an automatic rollback.
4.  **Traffic Switch (Promotion):** The load balancer or service mesh switches a portion of live traffic to the blue environment, which now becomes the new green (active) environment.
5.  **Post-Promotion Monitoring:** The system is monitored for a brief period. If key metrics (error rate, latency) degrade, an automatic rollback is triggered.
6.  **Decommissioning:** The old green environment is decommissioned.

## 4. Monitoring the Launch

During and after the launch, monitor the following dashboards and metrics closely:

-   **Grafana - System Readiness Dashboard:** Provides a high-level view of overall system health.
-   **Grafana - NVIDIA Services Dashboard:** Monitors the performance and health of Omniverse, Riva, and Merlin services.
-   **Business Intelligence Dashboard:** Tracks user engagement with the avatar, conversation success rates, and business KPIs.
-   **Log Stream (Datadog/Splunk):** Filter for errors or warnings from the production environment.

---

## 5. Incident Response & Rollback

### 5.1. Automated Rollback

The deployment orchestrator is designed to handle most failure scenarios by triggering an **automated rollback**. This will happen if:
- Health checks or smoke tests fail on the new version.
- Key performance metrics degrade significantly after the traffic switch.

The `rollback-service.js` will automatically revert traffic to the last known stable version and clean up the failed deployment.

### 5.2. Manual Rollback

A manual rollback may be necessary if a critical issue is discovered that was not caught by automated checks.

**To initiate a manual rollback:**

1.  **Execute the rollback script directly (with caution):**
    ```bash
    # This script should be developed to handle manual rollbacks
    ./scripts/manual-rollback.sh
    ```
    *(Note: The `manual-rollback.sh` script would be a simplified version of the rollback service logic, focused only on reverting traffic.)*

2.  **Declare an Incident:** If a manual rollback is performed, immediately declare a Level 2 incident in the incident management tool (e.g., PagerDuty).

3.  **Communicate:** Notify stakeholders via the established communication channels.

## 6. Post-Launch Verification

Once the launch is complete, perform the following checks:

-   [ ] **Verify Application Version:** Check the application's version endpoint to confirm the new version is live.
-   [ ] **Check Key Features:** Manually test the AI Avatar functionality on each platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.).
-   [ ] **Monitor Error Rates:** Ensure error rates in monitoring tools remain within acceptable limits.
-   [ ] **Stakeholder Sign-off:** Get confirmation from the product owner that the launch is successful.

---

## 7. Post-Launch Optimization

After the system has been stable in production for 24-48 hours, the following activities can be planned:

-   **Gradual Feature Flag Enablement:** Begin rolling out features disabled for the initial launch (e.g., `enable_conversation_learning`).
-   **Performance Analysis:** Analyze performance data from the launch and identify any new bottlenecks.
-   **Cost Analysis:** Review cloud provider costs to ensure the new deployment is operating within budget.
