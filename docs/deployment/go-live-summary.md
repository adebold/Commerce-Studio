## Go-Live Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Final Security Review**
   - Run the security hardening scripts:
     ```bash
     python scripts/enforce_password_policy.py
     python scripts/implement_rate_limiting.py
     python scripts/configure_cors.py
     ```
   - Verify all security measures are in place
   - Run security scanning tools

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Verify all environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure secrets are properly managed
   - Check database connection strings

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up monitoring infrastructure:
     ```bash
     python scripts/setup_monitoring.py --app-namespace varai-prod --monitoring-namespace monitoring
     ```
   - Configure alerting
   - Test monitoring dashboards

### Deployment
1. **Database Migration**
   - Back up the database
   - Run database migrations
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Deploy to production:
     ```bash
     python scripts/deploy_with_secrets.py --project-id ml-datadriven-recos --deployment-type kubernetes --environment prod
     ```
   - Monitor deployment progress
   - Verify all services are running

3. **Smoke Testing**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Check integration points

### Post-Deployment
1. **Performance Verification**
   - Monitor system performance
   - Check for any bottlenecks
   - Verify scaling capabilities

2. **Security Verification**
   - Run security scans
   - Verify access controls
   - Test authentication and authorization

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation
   - Create runbooks for common issues
   - Document deployment process

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

1. **Kubernetes Rollback**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/eyewear-ml-api -n varai-prod
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/eyewear-ml-frontend -n varai-prod
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   - Restore from backup if necessary
   - Run downgrade migrations

3. **DNS Rollback**
   - Revert DNS changes if necessary
   - Update load balancer configuration

## Conclusion

The EyewearML platform is nearly ready for production deployment. The remaining tasks focus on security hardening, monitoring setup, and final verification. Once these tasks are completed, the platform can be deployed to production following the go-live checklist.

The scripts for implementing the remaining security measures have been created but need debugging before they can be used in production. The monitoring setup script is ready to be used.

After deployment, it's important to continue monitoring the system, addressing any issues that arise, and iterating on the platform based on user feedback.
