# Cloud Run Deployment Improvements PR

## Overview

This PR introduces streamlined deployment processes for our application to Google Cloud Run, focusing on two main approaches:

1. **Single Command Deployment** - For quick manual deployments using `gcloud run deploy --source`
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - For automated CI/CD integration

## Changes

Added the following documentation files:

- **cloud-run-deployment-plan.md** - Comprehensive overview of both deployment approaches
- **simple-deployment-script.md** - Single command deployment script for manual deployments
- **github-actions-workflow.md** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD
- **deployment-implementation-plan.md** - Step-by-step implementation plan with timeline
- **deployment-process-diagrams.md** - Visual diagrams of the deployment processes

## Benefits

- **Simplified Workflow**: Reduce the number of manual steps required for deployment
- **Faster Deployments**: Streamline the build and deploy process (from 10-15 minutes to 5-7 minutes)
- **Automated CI/CD**: Enable automatic deployments triggered by code changes
- **Consistent Environment**: Ensure all deployments use the same process
- **Better Documentation**: Clear instructions for all deployment methods

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will be done in two phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Set up single command deployment (1-2 hours)
2. **Phase 2**: Set up GitHub Actions workflow (2-4 hours)

See `deployment-implementation-plan.md` for detailed steps.

## Testing Done

- Reviewed existing deployment scripts and documentation
- Verified that the proposed approaches align with Google Cloud best practices
- Confirmed that the GitHub Actions workflow configuration is valid

## Screenshots

See `deployment-process-diagrams.md` for visual representations of the deployment processes.

## Next Steps After Merging

1. Implement the single command deployment script
2. Test the single command deployment
3. Set up the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Test the GitHub Actions workflow
5. Train the team on the new deployment methods
