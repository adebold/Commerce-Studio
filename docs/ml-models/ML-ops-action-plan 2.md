# ML Monitoring System Operationalization Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive action plan to operationalize the ML monitoring system for production use. The plan is structured around five key areas that require attention before the system can be considered production-ready.

## Executive Summary

The ML monitoring implementation provides a solid foundation for monitoring ML models in production, including metrics collection, storage, alerting, visualization, and API functionality. However, to ensure production readiness, we need to address gaps in testing, security, scalability, operational infrastructure, and documentation.

This plan details the specific tasks, timelines, and resources required to address these gaps over an 8-11 week period.
