## 1. Overview

The VARAi platform utilizes a controlled, phased rollout process to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition of new features and updates to production. This process is managed through a combination of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), Kubernetes orchestration, and a custom Python-based rollout framework.

Key aspects of the rollout include:
-   Gradual exposure of changes to user segments.
-   Automated deployment and verification steps.
-   Built-in feature flag management for runtime control.
-   Defined rollback procedures in case of issues.
-   Comprehensive monitoring throughout the process.

## 2. Rollout Phases

The rollout process is structured into distinct phases, allowing for controlled progression and feedback collection:

-   **Planning**: Define the rollout strategy, success criteria, and potential risks.
-   **Preparation**: Prepare infrastructure, update configurations, and ensure deployment pipelines are ready.
-   **Internal Testing**: Deploy and test the changes with internal users.
-   **Alpha**: Release to a small group of external alpha testers.
-   **Beta**: Expand the release to a larger group of external beta testers.
-   **Gradual Rollout**: Incrementally increase the percentage of users receiving the new version.
-   **Full Rollout**: Release the changes to 100% of users.
-   **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the deployed changes in the production environment.

Each phase has specific entry and exit criteria based on monitoring metrics and user feedback.

## 3. User Segmentation

User segmentation is used to control the audience exposed to new features during gradual rollouts. Segments include:

-   **Internal**: VARAi team members and employees.
-   **Alpha Testers**: Users who have explicitly opted into early alpha testing.
-   **Beta Testers**: Users who have explicitly opted into beta testing.
-   **Low Risk**: Users identified with low-risk profiles (criteria defined separately).
-   **Medium Risk**: Users identified with medium-risk profiles.
-   **High Risk**: Users identified with high-risk profiles.
-   **All**: The entire user base.

User segmentation is typically managed through the feature flag system or specific deployment configurations.

## 4. Deployment Strategies

The platform supports several automated deployment strategies via the `DeploymentManager`:

-   **Canary**: A new version is deployed to a small subset of servers or users. If successful, it's gradually rolled out to the rest.
-   **Blue-Green**: A new version is deployed to a parallel "green" environment. Once verified, traffic is switched from the old "blue" environment to the "green" environment.
-   **Rolling**: Instances of the old version are gradually replaced with instances of the new version.
-   **Recreate**: The old version is shut down completely before the new version is deployed. (Use with caution, as this results in downtime).

The choice of strategy depends on the nature and risk of the changes being deployed.

## 5. Deployment Verification

Automated and manual verification steps are integrated into the deployment process to ensure the health and functionality of the deployed services:

-   **Health Check**: Verifies that service endpoints are responding correctly.
-   **Smoke Test**: Runs basic tests to ensure core functionality is working.
-   **Integration Test**: Executes tests that verify interactions between different services.
-   **Load Test**: Assesses performance under expected or peak load conditions.
-   **Manual**: Requires explicit human approval after manual testing or review.

Verification types are configured as part of the deployment process.

## 6. Feature Flag Management

Feature flags are a key tool for controlling the visibility of new features independently of code deployments. The `FeatureFlagManager` allows:

-   Creating and defining new feature flags.
-   Enabling or disabling features in specific environments.
-   Defining targeting rules to expose features to specific user segments (e.g., internal testers, beta users).

Developers should design new features with feature flags in mind to enable controlled rollouts and easy toggling.

## 7. Rollback Procedures

In the event of critical issues detected during or after a rollout, automated and manual rollback procedures are available via the `RollbackManager`:

-   **Snapshot Creation**: Before a deployment, a snapshot of the current stable state (infrastructure configuration, database schema) can be created.
-   **Automated Rollback**: Triggered by predefined monitoring alerts (e.g., high error rate, increased latency).
-   **Manual Rollback**: Initiated by an operator in response to issues not caught by automated triggers.

Rollbacks revert the system to a known stable state, minimizing the impact of faulty deployments.

## 8. Monitoring During Rollout

Comprehensive monitoring is essential throughout the rollout process. This includes:

-   **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracking resource usage (CPU, memory), network traffic, and database performance using tools like Prometheus and Grafana (configured via Terraform).
-   **Application Monitoring**: Observing application-specific metrics, error rates, response times, and logs.
-   **Business Metrics**: Monitoring key business indicators like conversion rates and feature usage.
-   **User Experience Monitoring**: Gathering feedback and observing user behavior.

Alerts are configured to notify the team of critical issues requiring investigation or rollback.

## 9. Developer Workflow

Developers interact with the rollout process primarily through the CI/CD pipeline and potentially through specific tools for feature flag management.

1.  **Code Changes**: Develop features or fix bugs, incorporating feature flags where necessary.
2.  **Testing**: Ensure unit, integration, and other relevant tests pass.
3.  **Code Review**: Submit changes for code review.
4.  **CI Pipeline**: Upon merging to the main branch (or a designated release branch), the CI pipeline automatically builds container images and runs automated tests.
5.  **CD Pipeline**: The CD pipeline, potentially orchestrated by the promotion process module, handles deployment to different environments based on the defined rollout plan and approvals.
6.  **Monitoring**: Monitor the deployed changes in pre-production and production environments using the provided dashboards and alerts.
7.  **Feature Flag Toggling**: Use the feature flag management system to enable or disable features for specific environments or user segments.
8.  **Rollback**: In case of issues, the operations team or automated triggers will initiate rollbacks. Developers may be involved in diagnosing the root cause.

Understanding this process ensures developers can effectively contribute to delivering stable and reliable software to users.
