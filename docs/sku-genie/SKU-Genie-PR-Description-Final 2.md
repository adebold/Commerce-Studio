# SKU-Genie: Complete Implementation

This PR implements the complete SKU-Genie system, including:

## Core Module
- Data models for client configuration, validation rules, and quality metrics
- Configuration management system for loading settings from JSON/YAML files
- Database connection manager for MongoDB operations
- Utility functions for data transformation and validation

## Data Sources Module
- Base interface for all data source adapters with a factory pattern
- Apify adapter for fetching data from Apify datasets
- Shopify adapter for fetching data from Shopify stores
- Manual adapter for processing uploaded files (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- API adapter for fetching data from external APIs with various authentication methods

## Quality Module
- Validator interface and implementations for field, schema, and relationship validation
- Fixer interface and implementations for fixing validation issues
- Quality manager for coordinating validation and fixing operations
- Comprehensive test suite for validation and fixing functionality

## Synchronization Module
- Conflict detection system that identifies differences between source data and database data
- Conflict resolution with multiple strategies (source wins, database wins, newest wins, most complete wins)
- Data merging functionality to combine data from different sources
- Synchronization manager to coordinate the entire process
- Scheduling capabilities for automated synchronization

## Maintenance Module
- Scheduler for executing tasks at specified intervals using cron expressions
- Data cleanup functionality for removing old jobs, orphaned data, duplicates, and invalid data
- Database optimization with index management and performance analysis
- Automated maintenance tasks for regular system upkeep

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a modular and extensible design:
- Each module has a clear responsibility and interface
- Common utilities are shared across modules
- Comprehensive tests ensure functionality works as expected
- Factory patterns allow for easy extension with new implementations

## Next Steps

After merging this PR, the next steps would be:

1. **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between all modules to ensure they work together seamlessly.
2. **Deployment**: Deploy the system to a production environment.
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the system.

All tests are passing, confirming that the implemented functionality works as expected.
