# Task: Develop SKU-Genie - Multi-Source Data Quality Management System

## Context
- The eyewear-ml platform currently imports data from Apify and stores it in MongoDB Atlas
- We've identified issues with data quality, including missing required fields and inconsistencies
- New clients often connect with poor data hygiene from various sources (manual uploads, Shopify, etc.)
- We need a comprehensive solution to clean, normalize, and maintain data quality
- Clients need visibility into data quality and the ability to manage updates
- We need to track usage for billing purposes and offer different update subscription plans
- This will be implemented as a new branch in our codebase

## Objective
Develop SKU-Genie, a comprehensive data quality management system that handles data from multiple sources, fixes quality issues, maintains data integrity on an ongoing basis, provides client reporting, and manages billing and updates.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support multiple data sources (Apify, manual uploads, Shopify, client APIs)
- Fix missing required fields in MongoDB collections
- Handle data inconsistencies between source data and our database
- Provide data validation against predefined schemas
- Normalize field values (e.g., frameShape, frameMaterial)
- Support client onboarding with initial data cleaning
- Provide ongoing data maintenance and quality assurance
- Generate data quality reports and metrics
- Track usage for billing purposes
- Manage client subscriptions and billing
- Provide client-facing reports in Commerce Studio
- Maintain reference between client and master databases
- Notify clients about available updates
- Support different update subscription plans (always on, pay per update, no updates)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Handle large datasets efficiently (10,000+ products)
- Security: Ensure secure handling of client data
- Scalability: Support multiple clients with different data schemas
- Maintainability: Well-documented code with comprehensive tests
- Usability: Simple interfaces for both developers and end-users
- Reliability: Ensure accurate billing and update notifications
- Integrability: Seamless integration with Commerce Studio

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing eyewear-ml platform
- Must work with MongoDB Atlas as the primary database
- Must support the existing data schema with minimal changes
- Must be implemented as a Python module within the current codebase
- Must follow the project's coding standards and best practices
- Must integrate with Commerce Studio for client-facing features

## Architecture

The SKU-Genie system will consist of the following core components:

## Next Steps

1. Create a new branch in the eyewear-ml repository for SKU-Genie
2. Set up the initial project structure following the architecture outlined above
3. Implement the core interfaces and data models
4. Develop the first data source adapter (Apify) leveraging existing code
5. Create a basic CLI for testing the core functionality

## Questions

1. Are there specific data quality issues we should prioritize?
2. What metrics should we use to measure data quality?
3. How should we handle client-specific data schemas and validation rules?
4. What level of automation should we implement for data fixes?
5. How should we integrate with the existing authentication and authorization system?
6. What billing models should we support beyond the proposed plans?
7. How should we handle updates that might break client integrations?
8. What level of reporting do clients need in Commerce Studio?
