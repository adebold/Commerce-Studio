# Master Eyewear Database Population Plan

This document outlines the plan for populating the master eyewear database.

## Goals

*   Establish a robust and reliable process for importing, validating, and reconciling eyewear product data.
*   Create a high-quality, comprehensive database that can be used for various applications, such as e-commerce, client portals, and data analysis.

## Data Sources

*   **Apify:** Web scraping platform for extracting product data from various online retailers.
*   **Manual CSV Uploads:** Ability to import product data from CSV files.
*   **Internal APIs:** Integration with internal systems to retrieve product information.

## Plan

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Identify and prioritize data sources (e.g., Apify, manual CSV uploads, internal APIs).
    *   Configure and test connections to each data source.
    *   Define data extraction and transformation processes for each source.

2.  **Data Validation and Cleansing:**
    *   Implement data validation rules based on the `DataValidator` module.
    *   Identify and handle missing or invalid data (e.g., imputation, default values, rejection).
    *   Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, units of measure).

3.  **Data Integration and Loading:**
    *   Develop a process for loading validated data into the master database.
    *   Handle potential data conflicts and errors during loading.
    *   Implement data versioning and auditing mechanisms.

4.  **Duplicate Detection and Reconciliation:**
    *   Utilize the `ReconciliationManager` module to identify and merge duplicate product entries.
    *   Define rules for merging conflicting data fields.
    *   Maintain a history of merged records.

5.  **Data Enrichment:**
    *   Enhance product data with additional information from external sources (e.g., image URLs, product reviews).
    *   Implement data enrichment processes using APIs or web scraping techniques.

6.  **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    *   Implement monitoring tools to track data quality and loading processes.
    *   Establish a schedule for regular data updates and maintenance.
    *   Create documentation for all data-related processes.

## Incremental Approach

To make this manageable, we will proceed incrementally:

1.  **Focus on Apify as the primary data source.** This aligns with the existing code and examples.
2.  **Implement the data acquisition, validation, and loading steps for Apify data.**
3.  **Test the end-to-end process with a small subset of products.**
4.  **Address any issues or errors that arise.**
5.  **Expand to other data sources and enrichment steps as needed.**
