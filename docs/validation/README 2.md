# VARAi Data Validation Services

This document provides an overview of the data validation services implemented for the VARAi platform.

## Architecture

The VARAi data validation services are built on a modular architecture that provides comprehensive validation capabilities for different types of data across the platform. The architecture consists of the following components:

### Core Components

- **ValidationRule**: Base class for all validation rules
- **ValidationRuleSet**: A collection of related validation rules
- **Validator**: Base class for validators that apply rules to data
- **ValidationEngine**: Central engine for executing validation operations
- **ValidationResult**: Container for validation results
- **ValidationReport**: Aggregated validation results for reporting
- **ValidationContext**: Context for validation operations

### Validation Types

The framework supports various validation types:

1. **Schema Validation**: Validates data structure and types
2. **Content Validation**: Validates data values and formats
3. **Relationship Validation**: Validates referential integrity
4. **Business Rule Validation**: Validates domain-specific rules
5. **Statistical Validation**: Validates statistical properties
6. **Temporal Validation**: Validates time-related properties

### Validation Rules

The framework includes a variety of built-in validation rules:

- **SchemaRule**: Validates data against a JSON schema
- **TypeRule**: Validates field data types
- **FormatRule**: Validates field formats (email, URL, etc.)
- **RangeRule**: Validates numeric ranges
- **RegexRule**: Validates against regex patterns
- **RequiredRule**: Validates required fields
- **UniqueRule**: Validates uniqueness constraints
- **ReferentialRule**: Validates referential integrity
- **BusinessRule**: Validates custom business rules
- **StatisticalRule**: Validates statistical properties
- **TemporalRule**: Validates temporal properties
- **ImageDimensionRule**: Validates image dimensions
- **ImageFormatRule**: Validates image formats
- **ImageSizeRule**: Validates image file sizes

## Domain-Specific Validators

The framework includes validators for different data domains:

### Product Data Validation

Validates product data, including:
- Schema validation for product structure
- Content validation for product fields
- Relationship validation for product references
- Business rule validation for product-specific rules

### User Data Validation

Validates user data, including:
- Schema validation for user structure
- Content validation for user fields
- Relationship validation for user references
- Business rule validation for user-specific rules

### Transaction Data Validation

Validates transaction data, including:
- Schema validation for transaction structure
- Content validation for transaction fields
- Relationship validation for transaction references
- Temporal validation for transaction timestamps

### Analytics Data Validation

Validates analytics data, including:
- Schema validation for analytics event structure
- Content validation for analytics fields
- Statistical validation for analytics metrics

### Image and Media Data Validation

Validates image and media data, including:
- Schema validation for media metadata
- Content validation for media fields
- Image dimension validation
- Image format validation
- Image size validation

### Integration Data Validation

Validates integration data, including:
- Schema validation for integration data structure
- Content validation for integration fields
- Relationship validation for integration references

## API Service

The validation framework provides a RESTful API service that allows other services to validate data using the framework. The API service includes endpoints for:

- Validating data using specific validators
- Validating batches of data
- Validating data using dynamic rules
- Managing validation rules and rule sets
- Retrieving validation metrics and reports

## Dashboard

The validation framework includes a dashboard for monitoring validation metrics and results. The dashboard provides:

- Summary statistics for validation operations
- Time series data for validation trends
- Distribution of validation issues by severity
- Performance metrics for different validators
- Detailed validation reports

## Rule Management

The validation framework includes a rule management interface that allows users to:

- Create and edit validation rules
- Create and edit validation rule sets
- Add and remove rules from rule sets
- Export and import validation rules
- Test validation rules against sample data

## Integration with Other Services

The validation services integrate with other VARAi platform services, including:

- ETL workflows for data ingestion and transformation
- API services for data access and manipulation
- Monitoring services for alerting and reporting
- Analytics services for data analysis

## Getting Started

To use the validation services, you can:

1. Use the validation API to validate data
2. Create custom validation rules for specific use cases
3. Configure validators for different data domains
4. Monitor validation metrics and reports through the dashboard
5. Manage validation rules through the rule management interface
