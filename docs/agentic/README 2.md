# Agentic ML Workflows for EyewearML

This directory contains documentation and resources for implementing agentic ML workflows within the EyewearML platform.

## What are Agentic ML Workflows?

Agentic ML workflows use AI agents to assist in various aspects of machine learning development, deployment, and operations. These agents can:

1. **Assist with development** - Generate code, suggest improvements, debug issues
2. **Improve data operations** - Create data pipelines, cleaning scripts, feature engineering
3. **Enhance model creation** - Suggest architectures, tune hyperparameters, analyze performance
4. **Streamline MLOps** - Generate monitoring code, create tests, improve CI/CD pipelines

## Benefits for EyewearML

- **Accelerated development** - Automate routine ML tasks to focus on high-value work
- **Knowledge distribution** - Capture best practices and make them accessible to all team members
- **Consistency** - Ensure consistent patterns and approaches across the ML codebase
- **Improved quality** - Leverage agents for thorough testing and validation
- **Documentation** - Generate and maintain high-quality documentation automatically

## When to Use Agentic Approaches

Agentic approaches are particularly valuable for:

1. **Repetitive tasks** - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation
2. **Knowledge-intensive tasks** - Debugging complex ML issues, optimizing performance
3. **Exploratory work** - Testing different model architectures or approaches
4. **Documentation** - Creating and maintaining technical documentation
5. **Code generation** - Implementing boilerplate code or standard patterns

## Integration with Existing ML Infrastructure

The agentic workflows described in this section are designed to complement, not replace, our existing ML infrastructure:

- **Feature Store** - Agents can help generate code for feature transformation and storage
- **Model Registry** - Agents can assist with model metadata documentation and version control
- **Training Pipelines** - Agents can suggest optimizations and help debug performance issues
- **Inference Services** - Agents can help with testing and monitoring code

## Getting Started

To get started with agentic ML workflows:

1. Review the [prompt_template.md](./prompt_template.md) to understand how to structure effective prompts
2. Explore [example_prompts.md](./example_prompts.md) for EyewearML-specific use cases
3. Follow [best_practices.md](./best_practices.md) to ensure quality and consistency
