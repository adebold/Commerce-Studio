# VARAi API Changelog

This document provides a detailed history of changes to the VARAi API across different versions.

## API Versioning Strategy

VARAi follows semantic versioning for its API:

- **Major versions** (v1, v2, etc.) may include breaking changes and require migration
- **Minor versions** (v1.1, v1.2, etc.) add new features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch versions** (v1.1.1, v1.1.2, etc.) include backward-compatible bug fixes

All API versions are accessible through their specific endpoints (e.g., `https://api.varai.ai/v1/` for v1).

### Version Lifecycle

1. **Preview**: Early access to upcoming features, subject to change
2. **Stable**: Generally available, recommended for production use
3. **Deprecated**: Still functional but will be removed in the future
4. **Sunset**: No longer available

## Backward Compatibility

VARAi is committed to maintaining backward compatibility within major versions. Any breaking changes will only be introduced in new major versions, and we will provide:

1. Advance notice of at least 6 months before sunsetting any API version
2. Detailed migration guides for moving to newer versions
3. Overlapping support periods to allow for gradual migration
