## Effectiveness Scoring Prediction

Based on the comprehensive coverage analysis:

| Module | Current LS2 | Predicted LS3 | Confidence |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Integration Tests | 5.0 | 8.2 | High |
| Performance Monitoring | 6.0 | 8.1 | High |
| SEO Face Shape Integration | 6.0 | 8.0 | High |
| Asset Pipeline CDN | 6.0 | 8.0 | High |
| Secure Template Engine | 7.0 | 8.3 | Medium-High |
| Database Integration | 7.5 | 8.4 | High |

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Executable Implementation:** All prompts must result in fully executable test code, not placeholders
2. **Realistic Test Data:** Comprehensive test fixtures must be created for all scenarios
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Concrete measurement methodologies must be established
4. **Security Validation:** Real attack scenarios must be implemented and validated
5. **Integration Testing:** Cross-module workflows must be thoroughly tested

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority:** Focus on Integration Tests (LS3_01) as highest impact
2. **Parallel Development:** Performance Monitoring (LS3_02) and SEO Integration (LS3_03) can be developed in parallel
3. **Security Focus:** Enhance all modules with additional security testing beyond base requirements
4. **Documentation:** Ensure all tests include comprehensive documentation and assertion examples
5. **Automation:** Build reusable test infrastructure to reduce implementation complexity

## Conclusion

The LS3 prompts provide a strong foundation for achieving 8+ scores across all categories. With the additional tests identified above and focus on executable implementation, the target scores are achievable. The prompts demonstrate excellent alignment with identified gaps and provide clear, actionable requirements for implementation teams.
