## 🔒 MANDATORY BACKUP PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Create Complete System Backup
```bash
# Create timestamped backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="/Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio-HEALTH-MONITORING-BACKUP-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Copy entire project with health monitoring system
cp -r /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/* "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Verify backup integrity
echo "Backup created at: $BACKUP_DIR"
ls -la "$BACKUP_DIR/docs/architecture/health-monitoring-"*
ls -la "$BACKUP_DIR/website/api/health/"
ls -la "$BACKUP_DIR/website/admin/js/health-dashboard.js"
ls -la "$BACKUP_DIR/HEALTH_MONITORING_"*
```

### Step 2: Create Health Monitoring Specific Backup
```bash
# Create focused health monitoring backup
HEALTH_BACKUP="/Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM-COMPLETE"
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP"

# Architecture docs
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/docs/architecture"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/docs/architecture/health-monitoring-*.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/docs/architecture/"

# Backend API
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/api"
cp -r /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/api/health "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/api/"

# Frontend components
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/js"
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/css"
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/help"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/js/health-dashboard.js "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/js/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/js/health-help.js "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/js/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/css/health-dashboard.css "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/css/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/css/health-help.css "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/css/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/help/health-*.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/help/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/help/quick-reference-guide.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/help/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/help/README.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/help/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/website/admin/index.html "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/"

# Testing suite
mkdir -p "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/test_specs_LS1.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/tests/health-monitoring.test.js "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/tests/package.json "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/tests/setup.js "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests/"
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/tests/cypress.config.js "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests/"

# Reports and documentation
cp /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio/HEALTH_MONITORING_*.md "$HEALTH_BACKUP/"

echo "Health monitoring system backup completed at: $HEALTH_BACKUP"
```

### Step 3: Verify Backup Completeness
```bash
# Verify all critical files are backed up
echo "=== BACKUP VERIFICATION ==="
echo "Architecture docs:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/docs/architecture/"
echo "Backend API:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/api/health/"
echo "Frontend components:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/js/health-"*
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/css/health-"*
echo "Help system:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/website/admin/help/"
echo "Testing:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/tests/"
echo "Documentation:"
ls -la "$HEALTH_BACKUP/HEALTH_MONITORING_"*
```

cd /Users/adebold/Documents/GitHub/Commerce-Studio
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin [repository-url]
# Then copy from backup and commit
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTES

1. **NEVER proceed without completing backup steps**
2. **Verify backup integrity before any git operations**
3. **Keep multiple backup copies in different locations**
4. **Test restore process before proceeding**
5. **Document any issues encountered during recovery**

## 📞 Emergency Recovery

If any issues occur during git operations:
1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Do NOT continue with git commands**
3. **Restore from backup**: `cp -r "$HEALTH_BACKUP"/* /path/to/recovery/location/`
4. **Verify all health monitoring files are intact**
5. **Contact system administrator if needed**

## ✅ Success Verification

After successful commit:
1. Verify all 25+ health monitoring files are committed
2. Check git log shows complete commit message
3. Confirm PR description is included
4. Test that all components are accessible
5. Validate backup can be safely removed
