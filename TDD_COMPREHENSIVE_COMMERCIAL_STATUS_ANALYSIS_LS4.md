## 2. TDD Implementation Strategy Analysis

### 2.1 Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Application

#### Implementation Pattern:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests for missing commercial validation features
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal functionality to pass security/compliance tests  
3. **REFACTOR**: Optimize for performance while maintaining test coverage

#### Specific Applications:

**Security Compliance Tests:**
```python
# RED: Test for missing zero-trust validation
def test_zero_trust_architecture_validation_fails_initially():
    # This test should fail before implementation
    validator = ZeroTrustSecurityValidator()
    result = validator.validate_multi_layer_security(mock_request)
    assert result.status == ValidationStatus.COMPLETE  # Initially fails

# GREEN: Minimal implementation
class ZeroTrustSecurityValidator:
    def validate_multi_layer_security(self, request):
        return ValidationResult(status=ValidationStatus.COMPLETE)

# REFACTOR: Complete implementation with all security layers
```

### 2.2 Test-First Development for Commercial Features
