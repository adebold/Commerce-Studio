## Implementation Priorities

Based on test failures, implement components in this order:

## Next Steps (TDD Green Phase)

1. **Start with Priority 1 (Security Foundation)**
   - Implement `SecureTemplateEngine` with Jinja2 sandbox
   - Create `InputSanitizer` with bleach integration
   - Build `TemplateInjectionPrevention` system

2. **Implement Database Integration**
   - Set up `DatabaseManager` with Motor async driver
   - Create `TransactionManager` for ACID operations
   - Build `SchemaValidator` for data integrity

3. **Build Error Handling Framework**
   - Define structured exception hierarchy
   - Implement `CircuitBreaker` pattern
   - Create `ErrorRecoveryManager` with retry logic

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement `PerformanceMonitor` for metrics
   - Build `CacheManager` with Redis
   - Create `AsyncOptimizer` for concurrency

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Validate end-to-end workflows
   - Test cross-module communication
   - Verify performance requirements

## Coverage Targets

- **Security Foundation:** 95%+ coverage
- **Database Integration:** 95%+ coverage
- **Error Handling:** 90%+ coverage
- **Performance Optimization:** 85%+ coverage
- **Overall System:** 80%+ coverage

## Performance Requirements

- **Generation Time:** <30 seconds for 1000+ products
- **Memory Usage:** <2GB during generation
- **Cache Hit Rate:** >95% for templates
- **Concurrent Operations:** 100+ simultaneous requests

## Security Requirements

- **XSS Prevention:** 100% protection against injection
- **Template Injection:** Complete SSTI prevention
- **Rate Limiting:** Configurable per-client limits
- **Audit Logging:** All security events tracked
- **Multi-tenant Isolation:** Complete data separation
