# Add Comprehensive E2E Test Framework

## Overview

This PR introduces a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the EyewearML platform. These tests address critical gaps in our testing coverage and will ensure the reliability of the full MVP before launch.

## Changes

- Created foundational test framework with fixtures and utilities
- Implemented page object models for frontend testing
- Added Docker service control for environment testing
- Developed four major test categories:
  1. Authentication tests
  2. Multi-region functionality tests
  3. External integration tests
  4. Complete user journey tests

## Test Coverage

This framework verifies key functionality across the EyewearML platform:

### Authentication Tests
- Frontend login flows (success/failure scenarios)
- API authentication validation

### Multi-Region Tests
- Region-specific routing (NA/EU)
- Data handling based on user region
- Regional failover capabilities

### External Integration Tests
- DeepSeek API integration
- Correlation Platform integration
- Vertex AI integration
- Multi-service recommendation flows

### User Journey Tests
- Complete user flow from signup to checkout
- Returning user journey with reordering
- Client portal journey for opticians

## Technical Approach

- **Page Object Pattern**: Used for maintainable frontend testing
- **Docker Service Control**: For testing service dependencies and failover
- **Test Data Management**: Sample users and frames for consistent testing
- **Clean Environment Setup/Teardown**: Tests clean up after themselves

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r tests/e2e/requirements-e2e.txt

# Run all tests
pytest tests/e2e -v

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/e2e/test_authentication.py -v
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add test coverage badges
- [ ] Expand test data scenarios
