## 🎯 Root Cause: Browser Cache

The 404 errors you're seeing are **cached responses** from when the files weren't available. The browser is serving old cached 404 responses instead of fetching the current working files.

## 🛠️ Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. **Chrome/Edge/Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+R`
3. This forces the browser to bypass cache and fetch fresh files

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open the admin portal in an incognito/private window
2. This bypasses all cached data

### Option 4: Clear Site Data
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Click "Clear storage" for the site

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After clearing cache, verify the admin portal loads correctly:

1. **Open Admin Portal**: https://varai-website-353252826752.us-central1.run.app/admin/
2. **Check Developer Console**: Should show no 404 errors
3. **Verify Styling**: Page should display with proper VARAi design system styling
4. **Test Functionality**: Navigation tabs should work correctly

## 🚀 Technical Details

The issue occurred because:
1. During deployment, there was a brief period when the admin directory wasn't included in the Docker container
2. Browsers cached the 404 responses for the missing files
3. Even after fixing the deployment, browsers continued serving cached 404s
4. The files are now properly deployed and accessible

## ✅ Confirmation

All assets are now working correctly on the server. The issue is purely client-side caching.

**Admin Portal URL**: https://varai-website-353252826752.us-central1.run.app/admin/

After clearing cache, the admin portal should load perfectly with all styling and functionality working as expected.
