# Refined Prompts for Layer LS5 - Critical Fixes Implementation

## Overview
Based on comprehensive analysis of LS3 scoring (72.4/100) and LS4 implementation progress, this layer focuses on completing the remaining critical fixes and optimizations needed for cross-platform propagation readiness. Current analysis shows partial implementation of security fixes but critical gaps remain in memory management and performance optimization.

## Critical Analysis Summary

### Progress Assessment
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive [`inputValidation.ts`](apps/shopify/frontend/utils/inputValidation.ts) implemented
- ✅ **Race Condition**: Fixed in [`AIDiscoveryWidget.tsx:167-175`](apps/shopify/frontend/components/AIDiscoveryWidget.tsx:167-175) using `connectionAttemptsRef`
- ⚠️ **Interface Consolidation**: Partial - duplicate `FaceAnalysisResult` still exists
- ❌ **Memory Leak**: Critical timeout handler memory leak still unresolved
- ❌ **Performance Optimization**: Missing connection pooling and message batching

### Remaining Blockers
1. **Memory Leak in Timeout Management** - High Severity (Unresolved)
2. **Missing Performance Optimizations** - Medium Severity (Unresolved)
3. **Incomplete Interface Consolidation** - Medium Severity (Partial)

## Prompt [LS5_001] - Complete Memory Leak Resolution with Map-Based Timeout Tracking

### Context
Analysis of [`tests/critical-fixes/memory-leak-timeout-handler.test.js`](tests/critical-fixes/memory-leak-timeout-handler.test.js) shows comprehensive test coverage for memory leak detection, but the actual timeout handler implementation still uses the problematic pattern that creates orphaned event listeners.

### Objective
Implement the final memory leak resolution using Map-based timeout tracking with proper cleanup mechanisms to achieve 100% memory leak test pass rate.

### Focus Areas
- Replace remaining dynamic event listener patterns with persistent handlers
- Implement `activeTimeouts: Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>` for session-based timeout tracking
- Add comprehensive cleanup in component unmount
- Ensure timeout handlers are properly cleared on successful responses
- Maintain existing 10-second timeout behavior with HTTP fallback

### Code Reference
Current implementation still has potential memory leak patterns in timeout management. The test suite expects:
```typescript
// Expected implementation pattern
const activeTimeouts = useRef(new Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>());

const handleChatResponseWithTimeout = useCallback((data: any) => {
  const sessionId = data.sessionId || 'default';
  if (activeTimeouts.current.has(sessionId)) {
    clearTimeout(activeTimeouts.current.get(sessionId));
    activeTimeouts.current.delete(sessionId);
  }
  handleChatResponse(data);
}, [handleChatResponse]);
```

### Requirements
- Implement Map-based timeout tracking using `useRef` for persistence
- Create single event handler that manages timeouts internally
- Add session-based timeout management for concurrent conversations
- Implement comprehensive cleanup in `useEffect` return function
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Socket.IO event patterns
- Ensure zero memory leaks under load testing (1000+ operations)

### Expected Improvements
- Memory leak test pass rate: 100%
- Event listener count: Constant regardless of message volume
- Memory growth under load: < 10MB for 1000 operations
- Timeout cleanup success rate: 100%

### Test Validation
Must pass all tests in [`tests/critical-fixes/memory-leak-timeout-handler.test.js`](tests/critical-fixes/memory-leak-timeout-handler.test.js)

## Prompt [LS5_002] - Performance Optimization with Connection Pooling and Message Batching

### Context
The current implementation lacks performance optimizations that are critical for production scalability. Analysis shows no connection pooling, message batching, or lazy loading implementations, which are essential for high-volume usage scenarios.

### Objective
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including connection pooling, message batching, lazy loading, and memory management to achieve production-ready scalability.

### Focus Areas
- Implement connection pooling for multiple widget instances
- Add message batching with debounce for rapid user inputs
- Create lazy loading for Socket.IO library to reduce initial bundle size
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
- Add memory usage tracking with automatic cleanup

### Code Reference
Current implementation creates new connections without pooling:
```typescript
// Current pattern - no optimization
const handleSendMessage = useCallback(async () => {
  const messageData: ChatMessageData = {
    message: messageContent,
    sessionId,
    shopDomain,
    conversationContext,
    faceAnalysisResult,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  if (useSocketIO && socket?.connected) {
    socket.emit('chat-message', messageData);
  }
}, [/* dependencies */]);
```

### Requirements
- Implement connection pool with maximum 5 concurrent connections
- Add message batching with 100ms debounce for rapid inputs
- Create object pools for `MessageData` and other frequently created objects
- Implement lazy loading for Socket.IO library (target: 50KB bundle reduction)
- Add performance metrics collection (response times, memory usage, connection counts)
- Implement memory usage monitoring with alerts at 50MB threshold
- Add automatic cleanup of stale connections and cached data
- Create connection reuse strategy for multiple widget instances

### Expected Improvements
- Bundle size reduction: > 30% through lazy loading
- Memory usage under load: < 50MB for 1000 concurrent operations
- Response time degradation: < 2x over 24-hour operation
- Connection efficiency: > 90% connection reuse rate
- Message throughput: > 100 messages/second sustained
- Initial load time improvement: > 25%

### Test Validation
Must pass all tests in [`tests/critical-fixes/performance-memory-leak.test.js`](tests/critical-fixes/performance-memory-leak.test.js)

## Prompt [LS5_003] - Complete Interface Consolidation and Error Recovery Standardization

### Context
Analysis shows that while input validation has been implemented, interface consolidation is incomplete. The `FaceAnalysisResult` interface still exists in multiple locations, and error recovery patterns need standardization to match the demo implementation's user-friendly approach.

### Objective
Complete the interface consolidation by removing all duplicate definitions and standardize error recovery patterns to provide consistent, user-friendly error handling across all scenarios.

### Focus Areas
- Remove duplicate `FaceAnalysisResult` interface from component file
- Consolidate all type definitions in centralized [`socket.ts`](apps/shopify/frontend/types/socket.ts)
- Standardize error messages to match demo implementation tone
- Implement consistent error recovery actions across all error scenarios
- Add suggested queries and recovery options for better user experience
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Code Reference
Current duplicate interface in component:
```typescript
// Remove this duplicate definition from AIDiscoveryWidget.tsx
interface FaceAnalysisResult {
  faceShape: string;
  confidence: number;
  measurements: {
    faceWidth: number;
    faceHeight: number;
    jawWidth: number;
    foreheadWidth: number;
    pupillaryDistance: number;
  };
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Requirements
- Remove duplicate `FaceAnalysisResult` interface from component file
- Import all interfaces from centralized [`socket.ts`](apps/shopify/frontend/types/socket.ts)
- Implement error messages matching demo's friendly, helpful tone
- Add error recovery actions: `retry_connection`, `browse_products`, `contact_support`
- Include suggested queries in error responses
- Maintain consistent error message structure across all platforms
- Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Create unified error handling utility for consistent behavior

### Expected Improvements
- Interface definition consistency: 100%
- Error message consistency with demo: 100%
- User experience improvement: > 20% better error recovery
- TypeScript compilation errors: 0
- Error recovery success rate: > 95%

### Test Validation
Must pass all tests in [`tests/critical-fixes/interface-consistency-error-recovery.test.js`](tests/critical-fixes/interface-consistency-error-recovery.test.js)
