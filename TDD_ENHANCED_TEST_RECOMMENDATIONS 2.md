# TDD Enhanced Test Recommendations for MongoDB Foundation Critical Issues

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive TDD recommendations for addressing the 5 critical issues identified in [`reflection_LS4.md`](reflection_LS4.md) through enhanced test coverage and implementation. Three new specialized test suites have been created to target the highest severity vulnerabilities with specific focus on race conditions, memory leaks, and security bypasses.

**Current Status**: Overall 73.7/100, Security 67.5/100, Performance 72.0/100
**Target Status**: Overall >90%, Security >95%, Performance >85%

## Enhanced Test Suites Created

### 1. Circuit Breaker Race Conditions ([`test_circuit_breaker_race_conditions.py`](tests/mongodb_foundation/test_circuit_breaker_race_conditions.py))

**Addresses**: HIGH SEVERITY race condition in circuit breaker state management

**Critical Tests Implemented**:
- **Atomic State Update Testing**: Verifies `_update_state()` is called within lock boundary
- **Lock Boundary Integrity**: Ensures state check and action are in same critical section
- **Concurrent State Transition Consistency**: Tests state consistency under high concurrency
- **Half-Open State Race Prevention**: Prevents race conditions during recovery transitions
- **Failure Count Atomicity**: Ensures thread-safe counter operations

**TDD Implementation Strategy**:
```python
# RED Phase: Tests that MUST FAIL until race conditions are fixed
async def test_atomic_state_update_under_concurrent_access(self):
    # Simulates 100 concurrent requests during state transition
    # Exposes race condition between state check and action
    # Fails due to non-atomic state management

async def test_lock_boundary_encompasses_state_decisions(self):
    # Tracks lock acquisition/release timeline
    # Verifies entire state decision is within lock
    # Fails due to improper lock boundary
```

**Expected Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Current problematic pattern:
async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
    async with self._lock:
        self.total_requests += 1
        await self._update_state()  # Outside critical section
    
    if self.state == CircuitBreakerState.OPEN:  # Race condition here
        raise CircuitBreakerError(...)

# Fixed atomic pattern:
async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
    async with self._lock:
        self.total_requests += 1
        await self._update_state()
        
        if self.state == CircuitBreakerState.OPEN:
            raise CircuitBreakerError(...)
        should_execute = True
    
    # Execute outside lock to prevent deadlock
    if should_execute:
        return await func(*args, **kwargs)
```

### 2. Cache Manager Memory Leaks ([`test_cache_manager_memory_leaks.py`](tests/mongodb_foundation/test_cache_manager_memory_leaks.py))

**Addresses**: HIGH SEVERITY memory leak in cache cleanup mechanisms

**Critical Tests Implemented**:
- **Orphaned Timestamp Detection**: Detects timestamps left after cache cleanup
- **Memory Growth Under Load**: Monitors memory usage during sustained operations
- **Atomic Cache and Timestamp Cleanup**: Ensures both structures are cleaned consistently
- **Concurrent Cleanup Safety**: Prevents memory leaks under concurrent access
- **Cache Size Overflow Protection**: Prevents unbounded memory growth

**Memory Leak Detection Strategy**:
```python
# RED Phase: Tests that MUST FAIL until memory leaks are fixed
async def test_orphaned_timestamp_cleanup_prevents_memory_leak(self):
    # Creates 1000 cache entries with short TTL
    # Forces cleanup that leaves orphaned timestamps
    # Monitors memory growth and orphaned count
    # Fails due to orphaned _cache_timestamps entries

async def test_memory_growth_under_extended_load(self):
    # Sustained 2-second high-frequency cache operations
    # Memory sampling every 100ms
    # Verifies memory returns to baseline after cleanup
    # Fails due to continuous memory growth
```

**Expected Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Current problematic cleanup:
def _cleanup_cache(self):
    for key in expired_keys:
        self._read_cache.pop(key, None)
        self._cache_timestamps.pop(key, None)  # May fail silently

# Fixed guaranteed cleanup:
def _cleanup_cache(self):
    expired_keys = list(self._cache_timestamps.items())
    
    for key, timestamp in expired_keys:
        if current_time - timestamp > self._cache_ttl:
            self._read_cache.pop(key, None)
            self._cache_timestamps.pop(key, None)
    
    # Additional orphan detection and cleanup
    cache_keys = set(self._read_cache.keys())
    timestamp_keys = set(self._cache_timestamps.keys())
    orphaned = timestamp_keys - cache_keys
    
    for key in orphaned:
        self._cache_timestamps.pop(key, None)
```

### 3. SQL Injection Bypass Prevention ([`test_sql_injection_bypass_prevention.py`](tests/mongodb_foundation/test_sql_injection_bypass_prevention.py))

**Addresses**: HIGH SEVERITY SQL injection detection bypass vulnerability

**Critical Tests Implemented**:
- **Unicode Normalization Bypass Prevention**: Tests Unicode equivalent attacks
- **URL Encoding Bypass Prevention**: Tests multiple encoding layer attacks
- **Advanced Obfuscation Detection**: Tests case variations and comment obfuscation
- **Encoding Combination Prevention**: Tests chained encoding attacks
- **Context-Specific Bypass Prevention**: Tests JSON/NoSQL/XML context injections

**Bypass Prevention Strategy**:
```python
# RED Phase: Tests that MUST FAIL until bypass prevention is implemented
async def test_unicode_normalization_bypass_prevention(self):
    unicode_bypasses = [
        "'; ＤＲＯＰ ＴＡＢＬＥ products; --",  # Fullwidth characters
        "'; D͎R͎O͎P͎ T͎A͎B͎L͎E͎ products; --",  # Combining characters
        "'; ДROP TΑBLΕ products; --",          # Cyrillic/Greek mix
    ]
    # Each should be detected but currently bypasses detection

async def test_url_encoding_bypass_prevention(self):
    encoded_bypasses = [
        "%27%3B%20DROP%20TABLE%20products%3B%20--",  # Basic URL encoding
        "%2527%253B%2520DROP%2520TABLE%2520products%253B%2520--",  # Double encoding
    ]
    # Each should be detected after proper decoding
```

**Expected Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Current problematic detection:
def detect_sql_injection_in_string(value: str) -> bool:
    value_lower = value.lower()  # Doesn't handle Unicode
    for pattern in SQL_INJECTION_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(pattern, value_lower, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True

# Fixed comprehensive detection:
def detect_sql_injection_in_string(value: str) -> bool:
    # Unicode normalization
    normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', value)
    
    # URL decoding
    try:
        decoded = urllib.parse.unquote_plus(normalized)
    except:
        decoded = normalized
    
    # Test multiple forms
    test_values = [value.lower(), normalized.lower(), decoded.lower()]
    
    for test_value in test_values:
        for pattern in ENHANCED_SQL_INJECTION_PATTERNS:
            if re.search(pattern, test_value, re.IGNORECASE):
                return True
    
    return False
```
