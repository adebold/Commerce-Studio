### Test Implementation Strategy

#### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Implementation

**Phase 1: RED - Failing Tests (Current State)**
All test modules are designed to fail initially due to missing implementations:

```python
try:
    from src.auth.manufacturer_auth import ManufacturerMFAManager
    # ... other imports
except ImportError as e:
    pytest.skip(f"MFA modules not implemented: {e}", allow_module_level=True)
```

**Phase 2: GREEN - Implementation Development**
Each test module provides clear requirements for implementation:

1. **Interface Requirements**: Exact method signatures and return types
2. **Performance Requirements**: Specific timing and throughput targets
3. **Security Requirements**: Compliance and validation standards
4. **Functional Requirements**: Expected behavior and edge cases

**Phase 3: REFACTOR - Optimization and Enhancement**
Tests include optimization validation:

1. **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression detection
2. **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage validation
3. **Scalability Testing**: High-volume and concurrent operation validation
4. **Security Hardening**: Advanced threat detection and prevention

    ]
    
    results = await execute_test_modules(test_modules)
    generate_coverage_report(results)

class TestIntegratedManufacturerSecurity(TestMFAImplementation, TestManufacturerAuthentication):
    """Combined test suite for complete manufacturer security validation."""
```

#### Shared Test Fixtures and Utilities
