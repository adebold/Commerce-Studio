# Business Services Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the Business Services for the VARAi Commerce Studio platform. The Business Services provide the core functionality for managing products, users, orders, and other business entities.

## Overview

The Business Services are a critical component of the platform's architecture, responsible for:

- Product management and catalog operations
- User management and profile operations
- Order processing and fulfillment
- Inventory management
- Pricing and promotion management
- Search and recommendation

```

## Implementation Approach

The Business Services are implemented using a combination of:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Each business domain has its own service
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business capabilities
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate via events for loose coupling
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Separation of command and query responsibilities

### Product Service

- Product catalog management
- Product variant management
- Product categorization
- Product search and filtering
- Product recommendations

### User Service

#### Order API Endpoints

```
# Order API Endpoints

GET    /api/orders                  # List orders
POST   /api/orders                  # Create order

PUT    /api/orders/:id              # Update order
DELETE /api/orders/:id              # Delete order

## Order Items

GET    /api/orders/:id/history      # Get order history
```

## Service Communication Patterns

The Business Services implement several communication patterns:

### 1. Request-Response

For synchronous communication between services:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Order Service
    participant Product Service
    participant User Service
    
    Client->>API Gateway: Create Order
    API Gateway->>Order Service: Create Order
    Order Service->>Product Service: Validate Products
    Product Service->>Order Service: Products Valid
    Order Service->>User Service: Validate User
    User Service->>Order Service: User Valid
    Order Service->>API Gateway: Order Created
    API Gateway->>Client: Order Created
```

### 2. Event-Driven

For asynchronous communication between services:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Order Service
    participant Message Broker
    participant Product Service
    participant Inventory Service
    participant Notification Service
    
    Order Service->>Message Broker: Publish OrderCreated
    Message Broker->>Product Service: OrderCreated
    Product Service->>Message Broker: Publish ProductsReserved
    Message Broker->>Inventory Service: ProductsReserved
    Inventory Service->>Message Broker: Publish InventoryUpdated
    Message Broker->>Notification Service: InventoryUpdated
```

### 3. Saga Pattern

For distributed transactions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Order Service
    participant Payment Service
    participant Inventory Service
    participant Shipping Service
    
    Order Service->>Payment Service: Process Payment
    alt Payment Successful
        Payment Service->>Order Service: Payment Processed
        Order Service->>Inventory Service: Reserve Inventory
        alt Inventory Available
            Inventory Service->>Order Service: Inventory Reserved
            Order Service->>Shipping Service: Create Shipment
            alt Shipment Created
                Shipping Service->>Order Service: Shipment Created
                Order Service->>Order Service: Complete Order
            else Shipment Failed
                Shipping Service->>Order Service: Shipment Failed
                Order Service->>Inventory Service: Release Inventory
                Inventory Service->>Order Service: Inventory Released
                Order Service->>Payment Service: Refund Payment
                Payment Service->>Order Service: Payment Refunded
                Order Service->>Order Service: Cancel Order
            end
        else Inventory Unavailable
            Inventory Service->>Order Service: Inventory Unavailable
            Order Service->>Payment Service: Refund Payment
            Payment Service->>Order Service: Payment Refunded
            Order Service->>Order Service: Cancel Order
        end
    else Payment Failed
        Payment Service->>Order Service: Payment Failed
        Order Service->>Order Service: Cancel Order
    end
```

## Domain Events

The Business Services publish and subscribe to the following domain events:

### Product Service Events

- ProductCreated
- ProductUpdated
- ProductDeleted
- ProductCategorized
- InventoryUpdated
- PriceChanged

### User Service Events

- UserCreated
- UserUpdated
- UserDeleted
- UserLoggedIn
- UserLoggedOut
- PreferenceUpdated

### Order Service Events

- OrderCreated
- OrderUpdated
- OrderCancelled
- OrderCompleted
- PaymentProcessed
- ShipmentCreated
